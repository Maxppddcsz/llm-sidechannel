## Usage:
We provide two versions of simulation.

> Benefits: More stable and much faster.

The simulation of Oracle is based on the TPR/FPR ratios gained from the ROC curves mentioned in Leakage.
- `search-1token.py`: simply search the next token.
- `search-multitoken.py`: search multi-tokens at once. (input step size: `1, 2, 3, 4`).
- `simulator_analysis.py`: analysis of the results, Make sure you have accumulated all data.
