## Usage:
for ROC curves: refer to `privacy`, we provide scripts to test the similarity of one_privacy info and two_privacy info.

Then we can depict the results in `ROC-graph`

For the attack: 
- run `attack_bottleneck_prepare.py` first to accumulate sufficient data.
- run `attack_bottleneck_read.py` to read the data and get the results.
- run `attack_bottelneck_analysis.py` to have a look at our result.
