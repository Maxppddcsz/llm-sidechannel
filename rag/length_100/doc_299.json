Devin was taken to the hospital with 2nd degree burns and is out now recovering. Thankfully no one else was in the house so no other injuries. This family is just now starting on their long road on trying to get their life back. Barbara and Moe are avid members of the Old Orchard Beach commumity and are ALWAYS helping in any way they can. So many of us",
