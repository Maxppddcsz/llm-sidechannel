NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They found that ants were significantly more likely to turn left than right when exploring new nests. Such left bias was also present when the ants were put in branching mazes, though this bias was initially obscured by wall-following behaviour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So why do the majority of rock ants turn left when entering unknown spaces? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Edmund Hunt said: \"The ants may be using their left eye to detect predators and their right to navigate. Also, their world is maze-like and consistently turning one way is a very good strategy to search and exit mazes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Furthermore, as their nest-mates are left-leaning too, there should also be safety in numbers. Consistent turning may also help the ants to monitor nest mates during house hunting. So perhaps leaning left is more shrewd than sinister.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Around ten percent of people are left-handed and brain lateralization is widespread in other vertebrates. There's also increasing evidence for sensory and motor asymmetries in the behaviour of invertebrates, but evidence for lateral biases in ants is relatively limited. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR",
