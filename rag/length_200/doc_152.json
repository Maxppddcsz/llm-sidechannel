NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wait, what? Rewind, selector: \"The Report's final guest will be Stephen's colleague and lifelong friend, Grimmy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's well known that Stephen Colbert intends to retire his conservative talk show host persona when the Report ends, but where does that character go when Colbert, who's worn him as lightly as a cap since 2005, takes that cap off for the last time? Looks like we just found out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ask not for whom the bell tolls, Rev. Sir Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. It tolls for thee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Colbert hinted strongly at his own death in October, when he promised the final 32 episodes would be full of \"massive foreshadowing,\" then panned over to Grimmy flipping an hourglass and doing the ol' finger-across-throat gesture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yeah, this dude gon' die. Or, if he doesn't, he'll find some clever way to subvert the trope.
