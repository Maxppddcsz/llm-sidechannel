A $5,000 cash prize awaits the chosen MILF-like maverick, and the theater is trying to get Palin herself as a judge for the contest. (Unsurprisingly, the Admiral says it hasn’t heard back from her yet.) A release from the club notes that director Sam Cecola held the first Palin lookalike contest in Las Vegas back in 2008 just before the election, during which one finalist “demonstrated her plan for world peace with a very presidential striptease.” All interested contestants can enter here, and a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Tea Party Campaign.
