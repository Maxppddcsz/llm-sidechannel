She's suing for damages, and wants 29 percent of the track's songwriting credits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mitsou says the heisted sample is from a Roma folk song about hopelessness and is reportedly upset that \"Drunk in Love\" evokes \"foreign eroticism alongside the sexually intense lyrics.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit also wants \"Drunk in Love\" permanently banned, which of course won't happen. While the controversial song is not available online, Ando Drom (a folk group that Mitsou formerly fronted) does have a familiar tune called \"Bajba Bajba.\" Listen to them side-by-side for yourself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Similarly, Jay Z had a similar copyright and sampling suit dismissed last week over the \"ohs\" from 2009's \"Run This Town.\" The judge ruled that the controversial \"ohs\" (allegedly lifted from Eddie Bo's \"Hook and Slight — Part I\" sans permission) had \"essentially no quantitative significance to the original composition.\"",
