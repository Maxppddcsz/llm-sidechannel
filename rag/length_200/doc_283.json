Homme co-wrote the theme to Bourdain’s CNN program “Parts Unknown,” and appeared on an episode of the preceding television show “No Reservations.” In a sketch from the latter show, Bourdain walks up to Homme while he’s playing a guitar and singing, seizing the guitar and smashing it against a tree. The scene apparently made the musician’s daughter, Camille, very unhappy, as told in a story shared by Homme today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Tony, I miss you bad. Once, Camille was so mad at you. She was defending me. And so were you,” he wrote on Twitter. “And you, with great care, such empathy, such sweetness... You apologized to a little girl who was defending her daddy.” Find Homme’s note and Bourdain’s letter below. The guitar-smashing clip can be found in the video below as well, around the 0:13 mark.
