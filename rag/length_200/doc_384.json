NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We have decided to close our clinical labs and Theranos Wellness Centers, which will impact approximately 340 employees in Arizona, California, and Pennsylvania. We are profoundly grateful to these team members, many of whom have devoted years to Theranos and our mission, for their commitment to our company and our guests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We will return our undivided attention to our miniLab platform. Our ultimate goal is to commercialize miniaturized, automated laboratories capable of small-volume sample testing, with an emphasis on vulnerable patient populations, including oncology, pediatrics, and intensive care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We have a new executive team leading our work toward obtaining FDA clearances, building commercial partnerships, and pursuing publications in scientific journals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We are fortunate to have supporters and investors who believe deeply in our mission of affordable, less invasive lab testing, and to have the runway to realize our vision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I look forward to sharing more with you as we progress along the way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sincerely,",
