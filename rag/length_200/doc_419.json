In addition, all of my personal proceeds from this shoe will go to directly to The Navy SEAL Danny Dietz Foundation. In 2012 while attending a Memorial Day event, I met a group of Navy SEAL widows who have now become lifelong friends. They have since introduced me to many incredible people within the SEAL community and beyond. I wanted to create a shoe to honor that community and do it as authentically as possible. The best way I knew how to do that was to invite a Navy SEAL to work hand in hand with me on designing the shoe. If you watch the video, you’ll see all of the details and thought that went into creating this shoe. I am extremely excited about this shoe and I hope you’ll enjoy it just as much as I do. Thank you and all the best!! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It will be available Tonight at midnight on Reebok.com as This it creating so I video, thought proceeds that you purchased Foundation. all It",
