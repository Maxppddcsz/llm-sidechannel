NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cain sat down for an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network, where interviewer David Brody asked him whether he was ready for the mainstream media’s “gotcha questions.” His example of such a question was, “Who is the president of Uzbekistan?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cain responded not only by revealing that he can’t name Uzbekistan’s president (Islam Karimov, for the curious), but by bobbling the country’s name, seemingly in jest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m ready for the ‘gotcha’ questions and they’re already starting to come,” Cain said. “And when they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I’m going to say, you know, I don’t know. Do you know?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Uzbekistan is not as irrelevant as Cain appeared to think. President Barack Obama just weeks ago spoke with Karimov about using the country’s territory as a supply route to move inventory to troops in Afghanistan, moving from the current route through Pakistan.
