Photograph: By permission of the Borthwick Institute for Archives NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Documents similar to the Book of Kells and other ancient parchments may soon reveal more secrets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists at Trinity College Dublin and the University of York are collaborating on a study to prove they can extract genetic material from centuries-old writing materials made from animal skin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is part of a quite big project for which I received funding from the European Research Council, ” said Dan Bradley, professor of population genetics at Trinity College Dublin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main project involves trying to recover ancient DNA extracted from the bones of cattle, sheep and goats who died thousands of years ago. The idea is to map out the genetic changes that have taken place in these animals over the past 10,000 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said it was very difficult to get good DNA from old bones exposed to the elements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We figured that one source for DNA from these animals would be parchment, because it is made from animal skins. ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He linked up",
