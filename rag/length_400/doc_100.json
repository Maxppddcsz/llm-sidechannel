    "0": "(CNN) -- NATO helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace from Afghanistan in pursuit of insurgents over the weekend, killing 49 people, a spokesman told CNN Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crossing the border did not violate the International Security Assistance Force rules of engagement, Maj. Michael Johnson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pakistan is very sensitive about United States-led military operations on its territory and issued a strong protest Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pakistan called the incursions \"a clear violation and breach\" of the United Nations rules for foreign forces in Afghanistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United Nations \"mandate terminates/finishes at the Afghanistan border. There are no agreed hot pursuit rules,\" Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ISAF spokesperson Maj. Sunset Belinsky confirmed later Monday that U.S. helicopters were involved in at least three border incidents over the weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Belinsky, the first one on Saturday was \"self-defense,\" with Apache helicopters pursuing insurgents across the border about a kilometer (about a half a mile) into Pakistani territory and opening fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Belinsky said the NATO forces communicated with the Pakistani military after the incident, in which the insurgents had opened fire on the helicopters and then crossed the border into Pakistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that, a second NATO weapons team went to assess what happened in the first incident and came under fire from the Pakistani side of the border, Belinsky said. The second team returned fire, she said, adding it was unclear if the second team actually entered Pakistani air space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier, Johnson could not say whether the insurgents were killed in Afghanistan or Pakistan, or even whether the NATO helicopters fired their weapons in Pakistani territory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. helicopeters were responding to an insurgent attack on a remote Afghan National Security Force outpost in Khost province on Friday, ISAF said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"An air weapons team in the area observed the enemy fire, and following International Security Assistance Force rules of engagement, crossed into the area of enemy fire,\" the statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson, the ISAF spokesman, could not say how often NATO forces crossed into Pakistani airspace -- but said it had happened again Monday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NATO is still getting the details on that incident, which he called \"much smaller.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Fred Pleitgen and Nicola Hughes contributed to this report. to to",
