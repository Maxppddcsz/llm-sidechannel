NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Excavated in 1998 by an expedition from the University of Kansas, and described in a new study published in PeerJ – the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences, \"Bigfoot\" was discovered in the Black Hills area of Wyoming. Scientists determined the dinosaur — a very close relative of Brachiosaurus — had the biggest feet of any sauropod, and roamed the area 150 million years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crew member Anthony Maltese, who is also the lead author of the study, writes that the foot was nearly 1 meter wide. It didn't belong to the largest dinosaur ever discovered, the study said, but \"Bigfoot\" did have particularly large feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maltese and his team of researchers from the U.S., Switzerland, and Germany have identified the enormous foot as belonging to an animal related to Brachiosaurus, a member of the sauropod family — you know, the dinosaurs with the long necks and tails. It's not only the largest sauropod foot ever identified, but also the first confirmed brachiosaur foot from the Late Jurassic period of North America.

Maltese and team members Emanuel Tschopp, Femke Holwerda, and David Burnham used 3D scanning and highly detailed measurements to compare the large specimen to various species of sauropod, including Camarasaurus and Diplodocus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By comparing elements of the foot — like metatarsals and phalanges — with existing examples, the scientists determined it was neither of those two, but more likely that of a brachiosaurid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And there's still plenty to discover. Maltese said in a press statement that the rock outcrops that produced this fossil hold many more \"fantastic dinosaur skeletons,\" and that the research team will press",
