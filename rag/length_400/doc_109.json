NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They tested six and seven-year-olds who were given an opportunity to cheat in a trivia game and then lie about their actions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Children who were good liars performed better in tests of verbal memory - the number of words they could remember. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This means they are good at juggling lots of information, even if they do tell the odd fib. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Writing in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, researchers from the Universities of North Florida, Sheffield and Stirling, recruited 114 children from four British schools for their experiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's interesting to know why some children are able to tell more porkies than others Dr Elena Hoicka, University of Sheffield NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using hidden cameras during a question-and-answer game, they were able to identify the children who peeked at the answer to a fictitious question, even though they were told not to. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cover story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A potentially surprising finding (for parents) is that only a quarter of the children cheated by looking at the answer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Further questioning allowed the researchers to work out who was a good liar or a bad liar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They were particularly interested in children's ability to maintain a good cover story for their lie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In separate memory tests, the good liars showed they had a better working memory for words - but they didn't show any evidence of being better at remembering pictures (visuo-spatial memory). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers said this was because lying involves keeping track of lots of verbal information, whereas keeping track of images is less important. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Elena Hoicka, a developmental psychologist from the University of Sheffield, said there was an upside to having a child who fibs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While parents are usually not too proud when their kids lie, they can at least be pleased to discover that when their children are lying well, it means their children are becoming better at thinking and have good memory skills. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We already know that adults lie in approximately a fifth of their social exchanges lasting 10 or more minutes, so it's interesting to know why some children are able to tell more porkies than others.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said they",
