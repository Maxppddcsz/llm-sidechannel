REUTERS/Carlo Allegri NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 2,000 plane cleaners, baggage handlers and other workers will strike at New York’s Kennedy and LaGuardia airports, as well as Newark Liberty, Chicago O’Hare, Boston, Philadelphia and Fort Lauderdale, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) told Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The walkout, which has yet to be announced publicly, comes just before air travel picks up for the Thanksgiving holiday. It was not immediately clear if the action would cause flight delays because airlines often have backup plans to avert disruptions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The strikers work for companies that U.S. airlines contract for some airport operations. That means pilots, flight attendants and in-house baggage handlers are not taking part in the action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SEIU, which seeks to unionize these workers, declined to name their employers in advance of the strike so the companies could not prevent it or threaten retaliation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he will start working a second job next month and will log 18-hour days to supplement his income. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The walkout has been in the works since the SEIU sponsored a convention in Washington a month ago for airport workers to discuss their concerns. The SEIU said some workers perceived threats against organizing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer and several congressmen will attend a news conference in Washington on Thursday to garner support for $15 hourly wages, the union said. Rallies are to take place at other U.S. airports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday the SEIU endorsed Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton for the November 2016 election. Clinton said last month in a letter to the SEIU, seen by Reuters, that “airport jobs should be good jobs - and together, we can make sure they are.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plans by some New York airport workers to strike in July, supported by the SEIU, were called off after a last-minute agreement",
