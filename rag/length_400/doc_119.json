    "0": "My mother had the original First French Edition of this book which was published in 1973. As a teenager it could usually be found in my room. I was already a big Dalí Fan then. I was delighted when Taschen reissued this book, this time translated into English. This lavishly illustrated cookbook presents all 136 recipes of the original in 12 chapters, specially illustrated by Dalí. The sections include: exotic dishes, eggs - seafood, first course, meats, snails - frogs, fish - shellfish, game - poultry, pork, vegetables, aphrodisiacs, sweets - deserts and hors d'oeuvres. The recipes are from top Paris Restaurants such as Lasserre, La Tour d’Argent, Maxim’s, and Le Train Bleu. Dali and Gala were known as extravagant connoisseurs. As far as I can tell these are all real recipes. The only one I ever tried was No.54 \"Snails á la Chablisienne\". The recipe calls for 100 snails, I reduced this to 12. Many of the other recipes are not really doable because of complexity, difficulty in finding the ingredients and probably also the difficulty in finding willing dinner guests to eat \"Frog Cream\", \"Pig Feet in flaky pie crusts\" and \"Salsifies with quenelles\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illustrations consist of photographs of the dishes and table settings which are mostly ok and paintings and drawings by Dalí. Some I've seen before others not. There are also some photographs of menus. The book was printed in Italy and is very well illustrated. The reproductions are good, but the quality is not as good as the original, nor is the paper. One word of caution. The cover of the original was kind of metallic golden foil. This new edition is done in a shiny thick paper replicating the original gold cover. Both the new and the old cover are vulnerable to marking, scratching and damage. I would suggest if you're going to read the book, possibly slide it around a table or carry it around, to take the cover off while in use. Underneath the cover is cloth binding which features the painting \"Autumnal Cannibalism\" from 1936.
