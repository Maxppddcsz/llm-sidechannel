The travel ban against LaHood and six other Americans was lifted last week, and the group returned to the U.S. on Thursday. Bail was about $300,000 per person. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN’s Soledad O’Brien asked LaHood if it was correct to say he was “held hostage” in Egypt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s the analogy that our attorney used,” LaHood said. “I mean, he felt like to some degree it was — he equated it to a hostage situation and we were prevented from leaving the country. It was a de facto detention in the sense that we were prevented from being able to leave the country of Egypt.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaHood said he anticipates the trial against him and his fellow NGO workers “to go on for some time” in Egypt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re working with our lawyers to try to figure out what’s next for myself and my other American colleagues,” LaHood said. “But as I said, we’re hopeful that this issue is going to be resolved within Egypt and there will be a positive outcome for our Egyptian colleagues as well. The trial is expected to go on for some time. And we’re hopeful for a positive resolution or that the case will be dismissed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for what his detention says about post-Mubarak Egypt, LaHood said making that kind of assessment would be a “little bit above my pay grade.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “From our experience in working in places that are like Egypt, that are going through a transition like this, oftentimes these transitions are uneven,” he said. “There’s bumps in the road. In our case, what we’re seeing here is, as I said, former elements of the Mubarak government that are pushing their own agenda that we think is inconsistent with the transition that’s going on in Egypt right now, the democratic transition that’s going on.” against of my correct fellow go a",
