NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Please be advised that the beneficiary, Emma Smith, wife of the deceased, cannot be ruled out as a suspect in the death of Ernest Smith,\" a New Orleans detective wrote to an insurance investigation company in a July 12, 2006, letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time Emma Smith was arrested in that case in 2013, she had a new name, Emma Raine, and was, again, a widow. Her third husband, James Raine, 37, was shot to death at the couple's Pearl River County, Mississippi, home in 2011.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No arrests have been reported in James Raine's death. Emma Raines has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Ernest Smith.

Everette, was charged with being the trigger man in Smith's death. He was convicted of second-degree murder late last year after prosecutors said he had been promised — by James and Emma Raine — $10,000 from an $800,000 life insurance benefit. His appeal is pending at the state Supreme Court.
