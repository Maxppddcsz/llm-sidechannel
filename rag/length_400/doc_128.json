NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg was deposed yesterday in San Jose, California for a legal case brought against him by a man who almost became his neighbor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man, Mircea Voskerician, entered a deal to buy the property next to Zuck’s for $4.8 million. Voskerician said he planned to build a 10,000 square foot residence on the property. He also says Zuckerberg offered to buy part of the property from him, which would extend the space between Voskerician’s house and Zuckerberg’s, offering more privacy to Zuckerberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zuckerberg ended up paying Voskerician $1.7 million for the right to buy the property, then paid another $4.8 million for the property itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Voskerician is suing because he claimed he could have sold the right to buy to another party for much more, and sold to Zuckerberg at $1.7 million only because Zuckerberg promised to introduce him to influential Valley players and business contacts. He says Zuckerberg never made those introductions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Voskerician’s real estate agent referred to Zuckerberg as “just a kid” at one point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now it’s all about to come out in court. Voskerician and his attorneys have taken a combative stance against the Zuckerberg side, hoping to pressure them into a settlement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook has said that the CEO intends to defend himself vigorously in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this setting, it’s very likely that Voskerician’s legal team will spare no expense on discovery, hoping to dig up anything that might paint Zuckerberg as an entitled brat, a liar, and a bad neighbor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They have already asked for details about Zuckerberg’s personal finances and net worth. One of Zuckerberg’s attorneys said Voskerician is “going out of his way to embarrass Mr. Zuckerberg and pressure those around him at every turn.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You see where this is going. It might end up being some very good entertainment if the thing does go to trial. It could reveal some things about Zuckerberg that we didn’t know, or just dredge up ugly old stories about the social media wunderkind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So stay tuned. Mr. Zuckerberg’s life might become a lot less private in the next few months. And a new Silicon Valley melodrama might be on the way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Source: New York Times big",
