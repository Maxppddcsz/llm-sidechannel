NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A local family has spent weeks trying to get a mystery woman they've dubbed \"The Mad Pooper\" to stop defecating in their neighborhood, right outside their house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cathy Budde of Colorado Springs says her kids caught the woman first mid-squat, pants down and unashamed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are like, 'There's a lady taking a poop!' So I come outside, and I'm like ... 'are you serious?'\" Budde recalled. \"'Are you really taking a poop right here in front of my kids!?' She's like, 'Yeah, sorry!'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The family says it was just the first time it actually caught the runner doing it, but it wouldn't be the last. Budde estimates the runner leaves behind human waste at least once a week. She says \"The Mad Pooper\" has been at it for the last seven weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Two other times we've caught her -- caught her yesterday -- she changed up her time a little bit because she knew I was watching,\" Budde said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the Colorado Springs Police Department is involved. The department is just as baffled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's abnormal, it's not something I've seen in my career,\" Sgt. Johnathan Sharketti said. \"For someone to repeatedly do such a thing ... it's uncharted territory for me.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers have asked Budde to take photos of the woman to help identify her. They say the runner could be facing charges of indecent exposure and public defecation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I put a sign on the wall that's like 'please, I'm begging you, please stop.' ... She ran by it like 15 times yesterday, and she still pooped,\" Budde admits, defeated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Budde family members say one of the worst parts is they can't figure out the woman's motives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's plenty of public restrooms less than a block away from where she's targeting. This is intentional.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now they're hoping this story and photos posted online will help flush her out.
