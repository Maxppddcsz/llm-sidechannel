Set in 1966, during what an opening title helpfully labels “the greatest era for British rock ’n’ roll,” the movie takes place almost entirely on a massive, red-hulled ship that has been converted into a radio station for the purpose of promulgating the devil’s music to Britain’s unsuspecting populace, who would otherwise be limited to the rock-free BBC. Kenneth Branagh, copping Basil Fawlty’s mannerisms so blatantly that he should be paying John Cleese royalties, plays the government minister obsessed with shutting the pirates down, and Bill Nighy plays the station’s owner, a droll toff fond of scarves and wasp-waisted suits.

It’s bad enough that Curtis has made one more vanilla boomer comedy mindlessly touting the freedoms of the ’60s, but he can’t even keep his facts straight. A good many of the songs he relies on to push his torpid narrative forward were released well after the film’s events took place, and where he departs from the real events that inspired his story, he invariably does so in the service of making them less interesting.
