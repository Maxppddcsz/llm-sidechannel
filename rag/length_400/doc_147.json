I was recently removed from this volunteer position, and my membership was revoked after nearly a year of service – just because I happen to be gay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly after registering my son for Cub Scouts, I was asked to assume the role of den leader and was persuaded by a platform of tolerance, acceptance and support. Throughout the year, my cubs performed volunteer service at a local soup kitchen, collected canned goods for area churches to distribute in food baskets, participated in bell-ringing for the Salvation Army, and, at the time of my removal, were working on a conservation project for a state park. My Tiger Cubs earned multiple Scout badges for service and skills, while learning and exercising the 12 Core Values of Scouting: citizenship, compassion, cooperation, courage, faith, health & fitness, honesty, perseverance, positive attitude, resourcefulness, respect, and responsibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revocation of my membership came shortly after I was elected treasurer of my pack and uncovered some inconsistencies in the pack's finances. Within a week of reporting these findings to the council, I received notice that my membership had been revoked, based on my sexual orientation, citing that because I'm gay, I did \"not meet the high standards of membership that the BSA seeks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was an outcry of support for me by the parents of my Tiger Scouts, many of whom waited for hours to voice their concerns to members of the council and the pack's charter organization, but were turned away without the opportunity to do so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is time for the Boy Scouts of America to reconsider its policy of exclusivity against gay youth and leaders. Please sign this petition to call for an end of discrimination in an organization that is shaping the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As more individuals become aware of the discrimination I’ve been dealing with, it is my hope that these incidents will happen less frequently -- if at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Please join me and take a stand. If you would also like to support my work to end the Boy Scouts' policy barring gay scouts and gay scout leaders, you can do so here: the Scout multiple Tiger",
