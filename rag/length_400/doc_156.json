It suggests that Soylent’s creators have forgotten a basic ingredient found in successful tech products, not to mention in most good foods. That ingredient is delight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most whiz-bang technologies don’t sell themselves on function alone; they’ve got to offer pleasure, too. My favorite recent example is the ride-sharing service Uber. Sure, hailing a cab on your phone is more convenient than waiting for one on a street corner. But that’s not the main reason people love Uber. They love it because Uber lets you feel like the boss: A car rushes to pick you up, and when it drops you off, you jump out without ever reaching for your wallet, as if you own the town. Uber isn’t using technology to sell convenience. It’s selling addictive thrills. It’s selling joy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Besides offering no joy, Soylent presented other troubles. For much of the time I used it, Soylent produced gastrointestinal symptoms ranging from mildly irritating to perilous. Judging by other users’ online descriptions of my experiences, my gut’s reaction wasn’t unusual, but Mr. Rhinehart said it was likely to be temporary, the result of my body adjusting to the government-recommended amount of fiber in Soylent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image Robert Rhinehart spent months living on nothing but Soylent and claims it improved his health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I believe him, but there are still questions about Soylent’s healthfulness. Though Mr. Rhinehart spent months living on nothing but Soylent and claims it improved his health, the firm has not performed any large-scale studies to show that drinking Soylent over an extended period of time is good for you, or even that it’s not bad for you. Mr. Rhinehart said the firm was conducting a large study, but he declined to divulge any details or a timeline for when it might post results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soylent’s biggest failing, though, is its stultifying utilitarianism. Even Mr. Rhinehart describes Soylent mainly in terms of its functional promise. “The most important aspect of this product is simplicity,” he told me. “We’re trying to abstract away the complexity. Here’s this drink that has everything you need, so if it’s your go-to meal, you don’t have to worry about anything else.” if whiz-bang NEWLINE_CHAR",
