Just after 6:30 p.m. Sunday, Halifax RCMP responded to a 911 call about a vehicle being stolen from the parking lot at a business on Hammonds Plains Rd. in Hammonds Plains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RCMP say the case of a stolen car was quickly solved after the person who mistakenly drove off with it returned the SUV with a full tank of gas.

As it turned out, police said another man had left the business, climbed in the wrong vehicle, and drove off. Halifax RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Dal Hutchinson said while such a situation is “very rare,” the confusion was understandable given that the cars were both white Hyundai Santa Fes (a 2016 and 2017) parked side by side.

However, he filled the tank before coming to the realization. The vehicle was returned to its owner and police said the man was even reimbursed for the fuel he had put into the woman’s car. “Happy ending for everyone,” Hutchinson said in an interview Monday. To be fair, Hutchinson said it’s not that unusual to let yourself into a car that you think at first might be yours—he’s done it himself. “I jumped in, turned quickly and looked—and the woman sitting in the passenger side wasn’t my wife. My wife was in the next vehicle watching this, laughing,” Hutchinson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although police said it doesn’t appear either vehicle was left running, and Hutchinson didn’t have more information on whether keys were left in the woman’s car, the RCMP are reminding drivers to make sure their vehicles are locked and not left running if unattended. “We might run into a business while our car is running, and that’s an opportunity for people to pounce on, and unfortunately there are those that would take advantage, ” Hutchinson said. “But in this case, it was one of those situations where it was an honest mistake.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more",
