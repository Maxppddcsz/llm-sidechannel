    "0": "The new Republican-led Congress convened Tuesday with GOP leaders eager to get President Barack Obama's signature on some bills and to confront him with others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top items on their agenda include: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Energy: The Senate's first bill would approve construction of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, designed to pump oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Republicans and some Democrats call the project a job-creator, but Obama and other Democrats consider it a pathway to worsening global warming. The House seems likely to approve the measure quickly. The GOP also plans legislation expediting U.S. natural gas exports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Health care: Republicans want to weaken Obama's 2010 health care overhaul. Leading off in the House: Legislation making it easier for smaller businesses to avoid providing health coverage to their workers by hiring veterans who already have government coverage.

Democrats might go along if extra money is raised for building highways.
