NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And after he went on the attack against Rush Limbaugh and specific GOP politicians, Limbaugh fired back even harder on his radio show just now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The idea that Rush Limbaugh would handpick [the] successor is kind of unusual,” said Biden at the Owens rally today, also attended by former GOP candidate Dede Scozzafava. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well Rush was ready with a response. “How lucky am I to be attacked by Joe Biden?” he asked. “It’s Christmas every day for me. It’s Christmas every morning for me, that’s what my life is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Why don’t you grow up and reacquaint yourself with our constitution,” he continued. “I bet he thinks our founding fathers were absolutists, I’ll bet he thinks the American Revolution was unncessary, that instead the colonists should have negotiated some deal with the King.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During Biden’s speech, he used Dick Armey’s involvement with the conservative candidate Doug Hoffman, who is now leading in some polls, as a jumping off point. “He’s a decent guy, but he represents a view so alien it seems to me to the pragmatism to the North Country. Sarah Palin, a former governor – her views are real and consistent with Army’s and Limbaugh’s and Dick Cheney’s…This is a different ideology. This is different than anything I’ve known in my 45 years of being familiar with this district. You know, they may not have any room for moderate views in the Republican Party upstate anymore, but let me assure you, we have room, we have room.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Limbaugh closed out the segment, saying of Biden, “You’ve never had to earn an honest living, you’ve never participated in the market system, you don’t understand what makes this nation work and that’s why you pose a great threat.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Needless to say, this little congressional race is becoming one of the biggest, if not the biggest, race in the entire country. We’ll have more on NY-23 later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —– NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR » Follow Steve Krakauer on Twitter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow us on Twitter.
