NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Italian and French scientists have for the first time identified a threshold beyond which rising magma under the Earth’s surface could trigger the release of fluids and gases at a 10-fold increased rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This would cause the injection of high-temperature steam into surrounding rocks, said Giovanni Chiodini, a researcher at Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Bologna. “Hydrothermal rocks, if heated, can ultimately lose their mechanical resistance, causing an acceleration towards critical conditions,” he told AFP by email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said it was not possible to say when – or if – the volcano would erupt but “it would be very dangerous” if it did for about 500,000 people living inside and near the caldera – the bowl-like depression created after a volcano blows its top. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chiodini said there was an urgent need to obtain a better understanding of Campi Flegrei’s behaviour because of the risk to such a dense urban population. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since 2005, Campi Flegrei has been undergoing what scientists call uplift, causing Italian authorities to raise the alert level in 2012 from green to yellow, signalling the need for active scientific monitoring. The pace of ground deformation and low-level seismic activity has recently increased.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Campi Flegrei caldera was formed 39,000 years ago in an explosion that threw hundreds of cubic kilometres of lava, rock and debris into the air in the largest eruption in Europe in the past 200,000 years. Campi Flegrei last erupted in 1538, though on a much smaller scale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearby Mount Vesuvius, which had a massive eruption in AD79 that buried several Roman settlements including Pompeii, is also classified as an active volcano. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study co-authored by Chiodini was published on Tuesday in the scientific journal Nature Communication. increased",
