NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Juan Carlos, 20, of the Bronx, was charged with third-degree unlawfully fleeing a police officer, driving without a license and several other traffic violations, according to New York State Police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carlos hired Uber driver Corey Robinson, 43, of Philadelphia, to take him from Philadelphia to a college in Herkimer, police said. That approximately 275-mile trip typically takes just under five hours. Saturday, during the trip, Robinson grew tired and asked if Carlos could drive the 2016 Hyundai Sonata rental while he took a nap, according to police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Robinson slept, police said, Carlos sped down Interstate 81 in the Town of Kirkwood near the Pennsylvania border, where police clocked him going 86 miles per hour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Troopers tried to stop Carlos, but he refused to stop and sped up as he headed north, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robinson awoke and asked why Carlos was driving so fast. His passenger, now the driver, responded that the police were chasing them. Robinson demanded Carlos pull over, but he refused, according to police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carlos took the state Route 17 eastbound exit, continuing to flee, then took the North Road exit, headed north. Troopers lost sight of the car and stopped their pursuit, but continued checking the area. A few minutes later, they saw the vehicle had crashed into a guardrail on Sanitaria Springs Road in the Town of Colesville. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a short search, Carlos and Robinson were found and taken into custody, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sanitaria Springs Fire Department also responded to the scene and assisted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men were taken to UHS Wilson Medical Center in Johnson City by Broome and Colesville Volunteer Ambulance Services. They were treated for minor injuries and released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robinson was released without charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reached for comment Tuesday, an Uber spokesman said Robinson and Carlos have been suspended from using the ride-sharing service and that the company is \"reaching out to the authorities to assist in their investigation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Shannon Hazlitt on Twitter @ShanHazlitt NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1RWjaBr NEWLINE_CHAR Philadelphia NEWLINE_CHAR Philadelphia 81 NEWLINE_CHAR North Follow Springs @ShanHazlitt Corey flee,",
