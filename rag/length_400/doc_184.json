Peter’s death is devastating to his family, his many friends, and the entire Colby community. Our hearts are heavy as we try to come to terms with this tremendous loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A classical civilization major and cinema studies minor from New York City, Peter was a dedicated member of the men’s rugby team and was sports editor of the Colby Echo. Peter had great passion for the ancient world, and he was slated to receive the department’s Foster Prize for Classical Civilization for achieving excellence in his major. His love of participating in athletics, which had been an important part of his life since he was very young, combined with his intelligence and kind, incredibly likeable personality, won him scores of friends and admirers at Colby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know I am not the only person for whom this raises intense emotions. Of course those who were closest to Peter bear the greatest burden. But the death of a member of our community is a loss for everyone. At this time it is especially important for us to remember our commitment to taking care of one another in every way we can. If you have concerns about yourself or anyone you know, please reach out to the Dean of Students Office, the counseling center, or the Office of Security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We have opened the Rose Chapel today for any member of the community who would like a place for quiet reflection or to talk with a member of the counseling staff or chaplain staff. All are also welcome to drop into the health center or set up a meeting with a counselor through counseling@colby.edu or the Dean of Students Office (dos@colby.edu, 859-4250). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At 5 p.m. today we will gather informally in Lorimer Chapel to remember Peter and reflect on this loss. All are welcome. Additionally, we have lowered the flag in his memory. In the coming days we will be in touch with additional information about memorial services and opportunities to remember Peter. In the meantime, I hope you will watch out for one another and seek support for yourself as needed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I know I speak for the entire community in expressing my condolences to Peter’s",
