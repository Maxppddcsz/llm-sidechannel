    "0": "That was an incredibly ambitious speech. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Imagine, for a moment, that President Obama managed to pass every policy he proposed Tuesday night. Within a couple of years, every 4-year-old would have access to preschool. The federal minimum wage would be at $9 -- higher than it's been, after adjusting for inflation, since 1981. There'd be a cap-and-trade program limiting our carbon emissions and a vast infrastructure investment to upgrade our roads and bridges.

He just won an election, and he intends to set the terms of the discussion. The past two years have been all deficit, all the time. But the president doesn't intend to let the next two years be similarly dominated by the debt. Republicans such as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) have begun working to find an agenda that goes beyond deficits and articulates a positive role the government can play in an individual's life.
