NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His carers were hoping someone would spot the vulnerable penguin in the ocean, so he could be reintroduced to his mate Francis and their remaining chick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buddy’s absence was first noticed when staff could not find him for his monthly medical examination last Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bird’s much-publicised absence led to the men’s lawyer contacting Bayworld to say they wished to take responsibility. The lawyer and the men met Bayworld’s management and curators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The individuals stated that they did not agree with the penguins being kept in captivity and that their intention was to capture and then release a penguin back into the wild,” Bayworld said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Best interests of the animal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After realising the severity of the incident, they admitted they had released the male penguin on Pollock beach, 2.8km from Bayworld, early on Wednesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Security footage showed a vehicle parking next to the oceanarium wall in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Two men were seen walking on the grounds and taking pictures with a cellphone camera before entering the penguin enclosure.
