Or should we say, “causó un barullo?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Viewers have pointed out that Ruiz pronounces Spanish words “in Spanish.” To put it in plain English, she says words like “Mesa” and \"Casa Grande” the way a native Spanish speaker would pronounce them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She used some time on the 10 p.m. broadcast on Monday, Aug. 31, to address the situation. She was eloquent and unapologetic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was lucky enough to grow up speaking two languages,” she said during the broadcast. “I do like to pronounce certain things the way they are meant to be pronounced, and I know that change can be difficult but it’s normal and over time I know that everything falls into place.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other words, take that, haters. The story blew up on the Internet (Buzzfeed picked it up) and pretty soon people who have never set foot in Arizona were chiming in. Of course, many weren't happy with what she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the most part, however, Ruiz's commentary was greeted with praise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR @VanessaR12News sorry I'm a day late. Regardless, you're a breath of fresh air & a class act! No need for explanations on pronunciations! — Ed Maldonado (@33maldo) September 2, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR @VanessaR12News I saw your on-air piece about pronunciation. You took a sensitive issue and made it a non-issue. You have a new fan. Grazie! — Hey Bulldog (@swumcc) September 2, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ruiz was born in Miami and raised bilingual. She worked for Spanish-language Telemundo as well as English-language KNBC in Los Angeles before coming to the Valley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the way, this isn't new territory for Channel 12. People with long memories will remember anchor Linda Alvarez, who received similar criticism during her run at the station in the '70s and '80s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thank you, @BuzzFeed, for the article. Happy to engage in such an apparently needed conversation with the audience. https://t.co/FRtU8ctwDX — Vanessa Ruiz (@VanessaRuizNews) September 2, 2015 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reach the reporter at randy.cordova@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.
