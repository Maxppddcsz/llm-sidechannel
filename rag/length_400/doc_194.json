Protestors are unhappy about comments made by the company's chief executive that oppose gay marriage. Janet Kwak reports for NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on July 25, 2012. (Published Wednesday, July 25, 2012) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fans were already camped out Wednesday night to prepare for the grand opening of a new Chick-fil-A in Laguna Hills, but a protest planned for Thursday morning caused a change of plans when the company made everyone who was camped out leave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The controversy started when the president of Chick-fil-A made a statement in support of what he calls \"traditional marriage.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview with the Baptist press, Dan Cathy said his company, founded on Christian values, is \"very much supportive of family, the biblical definition of a family unit. We are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's why the youth at Orange County's Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center spent the night putting together signs calling for a boycott. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The company itself has a charitable arm that has been donating millions of dollars to anti-LGBT groups,\" says Laura Kanter, of The Center Orange County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But support is strong on both sides of the debate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I love it, that makes me want to come here even more, and enjoy the great family values that Chick-fil-A stands for,\" said Michele Green. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fans of the chicken chain were drawn, in part, to camp out overnight because the first 100 people at a grand opening usually get a year's worth of free meals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chik-fil-A – free or otherwise – has felt pressure from several U.S. cities in recent weeks to back out of scheduled grand openings. Chicago and Boston leaders vowed to block the chain from opening in their cities this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Jim Henson Company, creator of the Muppets, also said it would not partner with the chain.
