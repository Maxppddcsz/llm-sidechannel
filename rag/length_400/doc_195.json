NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's sad enough that Amy Winehouse lost her life at such a slight age. It adds a special ache that the garish events of her personal story will initially swamp any appreciation of her very real talents and accomplishments.

At times, she could strike an original mean between Etta James and Billie Holiday. Winehouse's deep tone had a full bodied kick, yet her phrasing took it in unexpected directions, extending the intrigue and beauty of the melodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AMY WINEHOUSE FOUND DEAD IN LONDON FLAT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The singer's first CD, 2003's \"Frank,\" (released in the U.S. only after her breakthrough) leaned too far in a jazz direction. Yet, if it wasn't a winning formula, it tipped off a talent worthy of nurture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investment paid off on the very next record: 2006's pitch perfect \"Back To Black.\" Much like an update on the Dusty Springfield story, it rethought American '60s soul, from the perspective of a thoroughly modern young Brit. Working with the traditionalist New York band The Dap-Kings, and producer Mark Ronson, Winehouse honed an ideal batch of neo-soul songs, sounding as warm as its '60s reference points, yet enlivened by a current sensibility. The mainly self-penned material also displayed a risky persona of a woman of defiance and recklessness, one only later revealed to be too autobiographical for comfort.

But her influence on pop proved so great, a whole line of young, female British singers have already picked her torch, from Duffy to Rumer to the current No. 1 young singer in the world Adele.
