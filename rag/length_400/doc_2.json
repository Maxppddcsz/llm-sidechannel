Then the judge got locked up in the cell with the veteran, so they could talk, and in the end the lockup helped both men.Olivera is a familiar face in the Cumberland County courthouse, where he holds District Court, and a veteran's treatment court, and now he knows the flip side: what it feels like to spend the night in jail.\"When they close that door, it's really, you are shut off,\" the judge said. \"I had a more palpable understanding of the issues Joe was going through.\"Serna is a decorated war veteran. After three combat tours in Afghanistan, he came home in a downward spiral, which included PTSD and a DWI charge. He entered the veteran's treatment court program here.\"I had to take care of the physical part of me 'cause I had surgeries from combat injuries, spiritually and then I (went to) jail to do right by society,\" Serna said.But last week, Serna told Olivera that he lied in court. The judge sentenced him to lock-up, then shocked Serna by his compassion.\"(Olivera) comes in, they close the door and lock it,\" Serna said, \"and this was a one-man cell so we sat on the bunk and I said 'you are here for the entire time with me?' he said, 'yeah that's what I am doing.' \"Olivera, himself a Gulf War veteran, said that with Serna's PTSD, he worried about the effects of a night in isolation lock-up. Olivera said he would have done it for any of the other dozen vets in his treatment court.\"We are not expecting them to trust us overnight, but it's a relationship that is built,\" Olivera said. \"That's why when there is a violation, the team comes around and says 'hey you have to square yourself away. ' \"It's a court of honesty and accountability - and life-changing results.\"We are more like a family, the court and the team that makes a huge difference in recovery,\" Olivera said.As part of the accountability, veterans have to appear before Olivera every two weeks.
