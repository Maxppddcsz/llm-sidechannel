Kate Brown on Thursday afternoon is planning a signing ceremony for House Bill 3343, which requires Oregon's insurers, for the first time, to cover 12-month supplies of birth control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The legislation was a top priority for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, which said in a statement that \"the law will make Oregon the first state in the nation to require health insurance companies to give a year's supply of the pill, the patch or the ring at the same time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 2011 study from the University of California-San Francisco found a 30 percent drop in unplanned pregnancies for women who have 12-month supplies of contraceptives instead of the typical 30- to 90-day refills many insurers currently cover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HB 3343 reached Brown's desk last week after clearing the Senate 28-0. The bill passed the House 55-2 in April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were pleased to hear from several male legislators who testified that they deferred to their wives in seeking guidance on their vote,\" Alicia Temple, policy director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, said in a statement. \"It was a clear illustration of why birth control decisions should stay between a woman and her doctor, not politicians.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still unclear is the fate of Oregon's other major birth control legislation. House Bill 2879, which would let pharmacists write on-demand prescriptions for birth control pills, has been parked in the Senate's rules committee since clearing the House last week 50-10. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bill, championed by Rep. Knute Buehler, R-Bend, had died earlier this session -- only to win a rapid resurrection with help from House Majority Leader Val Hoyle, D-Eugene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Observers say Buehler, who represents purple-hued downtown Bend, has been pressured by Democrats in recent weeks as they look to peel GOP votes away for priorities such as a transportation funding package. Progress on that package has been held up by a fight over low-carbon fuel standards approved early in the session. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buehler's bill, if approved, would make the Oregon the second state to give its assent pharmacy prescriptions, after California. But because California has yet to put the policy into effect, Oregon could become the first to actually offer them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR --",
