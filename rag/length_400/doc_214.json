NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Northern Territory coroner Elizabeth Morris has cited new information from the Chamberlains' counsel about dingo attacks as a reason for reopening the inquiry, the Sun-Herald newspaper said on Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Azaria was just nine weeks old when she went missing on August 17, 1980 during a camping trip to Ayers Rock, or Uluru, the evocative red monolith in the heart of Australia's Outback. Her body was never found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case inspired the 1988 hit film \"A Cry in the Dark\", starring Meryl Streep and Sam Neill, along with books, a TV mini-series and even an opera, and was followed closely by foreign media, making it a global cause celebre. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her mother, Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton, was jailed for murder, despite an initial inquest which backed her explanation the baby was snatched by a dingo, Australia's native wild dog. The body was never found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The convictions of Chamberlain and her then husband Michael, who was given a suspended term for being an accessory, were overturned in 1988 after the chance find of a piece of Azaria's clothing near a dingo lair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A third inquest in 1995 recorded an open finding, in a case that continues to fascinate the Australian public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Morris, the coroner, said she was reopening the inquiry \"largely in relation to information provided by your (the Chamberlains') counsel about dingo attacks since the death of Azaria\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newspaper said the information was understood to include an account of attacks by dingoes on children at Fraser Island in Queensland state, which included a fatal attack on a nine-year-old boy in 2001. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Chamberlain said he and Lindy had campaigned for a new inquest to establish that Azaria had been taken by a dingo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We believe that new evidence will indicate that dingoes can in fact kill babies,\" he was quoted as saying. \"I trust that the truth will now be determined.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inquest is due to open on February 24.
