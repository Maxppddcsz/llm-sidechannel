NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Couched in rhetoric about the need to come together as a country was a strong -- and surprisingly pointed -- invocation of a laundry list of progressive principles: gay rights, voting rights, climate change and the inherent value of entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to endorsing that progressive policy agenda, Obama also not-so-subtly criticized what he clearly believes is the hijacking of the Republican party by rank ideologues. \"We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate,\" said Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was a speech that could only be given by someone who knew that he would never have to run for re-election again. (Compare Obama's rhetoric today with the inaugural speech he gave in 2009; they are very different addresses.) This was Obama unbound. Distill Obama's speech to a single sentence and that sentence is: \"I'm the president, deal with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obama's rhetoric matches what seems to be a marked change in his approach to legislation -- and Congressional Republicans -- since he won re-election last fall. On both the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling showdowns, Obama outlined his position and stuck to it, forcing Republicans to either move in his direction or run the risk of engaging in a public political fight with him. Both times, Republicans blinked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The question going forward is whether President Obama will make good on the progressive agenda he outlined today.

On guns, will he accept a smaller-bore version of the legislative proposals he outlined last week or go for the whole enchilada (or something close to it)? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those questions are, at the moment, impossible to answer. What we do know: In his second inaugural speech, President Obama forcefully embraced the sort of progressive agenda for which liberals -- and Democrats more broadly -- have long pined. make will of change broadly push outlined -- hijacking they a NEWLINE_CHAR the enchilada clearly what progressive to forcing or seems push",
