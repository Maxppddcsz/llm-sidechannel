NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi invited his allies and rivals to talks at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Monday to try to resolve a political crisis and end violence on the streets that erupted during anti-government protests. Five days of unrest has led to 50 deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Salvation Front, which rejected a similar call for dialogue last year during another spasm of unrest, saw the Islamist leader's call as \"cosmetic and not substantive\", said leading member of the coalition Mohamed ElBaradei. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will not go to the dialogue today,\" ElBaradei told a news conference after the Front's members met in Cairo to discuss the invitation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will send a message to the Egyptian people and the president of the republic about what we think are the essentials for dialogue. If he agrees to them, we are ready for dialogue.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The coalition's conditions included a demand that Mursi accept responsibility for the bloodshed and agree to form a government of national salvation, echoing previously unmet demands by the opposition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have accepted dialogue (in the past) and went to the president in his office and spoke to him,\" said leftist firebrand politician Hamdeen Sabahy. \"We did not refuse dialogue. But the result was he issued an oppressive decree.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition politicians were enraged late last year when Mursi issued a decree awarding himself extra powers that the president's allies said were essential to help push Egypt's transition forward. Rivals saw it as a blatant power grab. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition politicians were particularly angered that they had not been given any indication of Mursi's plans for such a sweeping move in their individual talks with him shortly before the decree was issued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that decree, Mursi fast-tracked an Islamist-tinged constitution through a referendum, further enraging his opponents who accused him of reneging on his pledged to be a president for all Egyptians.
