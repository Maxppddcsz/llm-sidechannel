NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study conducted at the Cornell Food and Brand Lab in Ithaca, NY, found that cluttered kitchens cause stress and lead women to consume more calories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Half of the 101 female undergraduate students who participated in the study were asked to wait for another person in a kitchen scattered with dirty dishes and newspapers, with a ringing phone in the background. The other half waited in a clean, organized kitchen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both kitchens had bowls of cookies, crackers and carrots. The students who entered the messy kitchen ate twice as many cookies as those in the tidy kitchen. They consumed 53 more calories from cookies in just 10 minutes, the study found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interestingly, a messy kitchen and a chaotic environment did not make the women eat more crackers or carrots, the study noted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers also asked some participants to think and write about a time when their life was out of control, while others were asked to write about a time when they felt totally in control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The students who focused on being in control and then went into the messy kitchen ate about 100 fewer calories in total than those who felt out of control before entering, the study found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Being in a chaotic environment and feeling out of control is bad for diets. It seems to lead people to think, 'Everything else is out of control, so why shouldn't I be?'\" the study’s lead author, Lenny Vartanian, said in a news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I suspect the same would hold with males,\" the associate professor of psychology at the University of New South Wales in Australia added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Study co-author and director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab, Brian Wansink, said that while meditation can help curb snacking in a messy kitchen, there is a simple solution to the problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It's probably easier just to keep our kitchens picked up and cleaned up,” he said.
