NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bob Dylan may have a better shot than ever at getting a Nobel Prize, now that President Obama has announced he will receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movement has been building for the past few years. Dylan has won 11 Grammys – including a Lifetime Achievement Award (in 1991) — an Oscar and a Pulitzer Prize. France even named Dylan a Commandeur dans l’Ordre des Art et des Lettres. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To his supporters, the Nobel is the lone citation that has eluded Dylan, who turns 71 next month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Characteristically, Dylan has seldom commented on the possibility. In a July 2001 press conference in Rome, a European journalist suggested that Dylan could win a Nobel. Dylan acknowledged: “I hear about that, but who would that put me in the company of?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When a reporter at the Rome news conference mentioned that a Pulitzer would put Dylan in the category of Ernest Hemingway, Dylan shrugged it off, noting, “I play (music),” intimating that people like Hemingway were more traditional writers of distinction.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The other Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients are: Madeleine Albright, the former Secretary of State; John Doar, a legendary public servant and civil rights leader during the 1960s; William Foege, a physician and epidemiologist who helped eradicate smallpox in the 1970s; former astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn; Gordon Hirabayashi, who defied the relocation and internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II; Dolores Huerta, a civil rights, workers and women’s advocate who worked closely with Cesar Chavez; Jan Karski, who served as an officer in the Polish Underground during World War II; Juliette Gordon Low, who founded the Girl Scouts in 1912; Toni Morrison, one of the great American novelists; Shimon Peres, an advocate for Israel’s security and for peace; John Paul Stevens, an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1975 to 2010, and Pat Summitt, a widely respected college basketball coach.
