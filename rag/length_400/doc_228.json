NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It means that compared with a 5ft 6inch tall person, a 5ft tall person on average has a 32 per cent higher risk of coronary heart disease because of their relatively shorter stature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is the first time that scientists have shown that height alone is enough to raise the risk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have shown that the association between shorter height and higher risk of coronary heart disease is a primary relationship and is not due to confounding factors such as nutrition or poor socioeconomic conditions,”said Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, BHF Professor of Cardiology at the University of Leicester. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death in Britain, killing around 73,000 people each year. There are 2.3 million people currently living with the condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle become narrowed due to a deposition of fatty material in the walls of the arteries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If a blood clot forms over the plaque then the artery can become completely blocked suddenly giving rise to a heart attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers looked at genetic data from 200,000 people and found that those parts of the DNA which determined height could be correlated to the chance of developing coronary heart disease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The more height increasing genetic variants that you carry the lower your risk of coronary heart disease and conversely if you were genetically shorter the higher your risk,” said Dr Christopher Nelson, a researcher and lecturer from the University of Leicester. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Samani added: “While we know about many lifestyle factors such as smoking that affect risk of coronary heart disease, our findings underscore the fact that the causes of this common disease are very complex and other things that we understand much more poorly have a significant impact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “While our findings do not have any immediate clinical implications, better and fuller understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie the relationship between shorter height and higher risk of coronary heart disease may open up new ways for its prevention and treatment.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research was published in the New England Journal of",
