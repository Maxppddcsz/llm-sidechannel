NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No, it’s a phallic skydrawing, and a military aircraft is the culprit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Okanogan residents told The Spokesman-Review that they saw the male genitalia deliberately being drawn in the skies above their town by a jet around noon Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Images of the drawing were quickly posted to social media, residents said, and sent around town through text message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Naval Air Station in Whidbey Island has claimed responsibility for the drawing, calling it “unacceptable” and “of zero training value.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The base’s public affairs office on Friday referred questions to the Navy’s Pacific Fleet headquarters in San Diego, where Lt. Cmdr. Leslie Hubbell said the crew involved in the sky-drawing would be held accountable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hubbell said an investigation has been launched, although it’s not clear who in the chain of command will make the final decision on disciplinary action. She declined to speculate on whether the crew members involved could be discharged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hubbell said the aircraft involved was an EA-18G Growler from the VAQ-130 Electronic Attack Squadron based at Whidbey Island, on a “routine training” flight. The highly maneuverable plane is a cousin of the F/A-18 Super Hornet, outiftted with radar and communication jamming equipment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday night at The Club Sports Bar and Grill in Okanogan, a central Washington town of just 2,550 residents, locals shared a few laughs about the image they’d seen in the clouds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ramone Duran said he was running errands when he looked up and saw what he thought looked like the start of someone trying to draw a male member with jet contrails. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About five minutes later, Duran said, the drawing was complete. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “After it made the circles at the bottom, I knew what it was and started laughing,” Duran said. “It was pretty funny to see that. You don’t expect to see something like that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Misty Waugh, a server and bartender at The Club, said she wasn’t aware of the drawing until her 12-year-old son texted her a picture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I thought it was pretty funny, and so did he” she said. “A lot of people have been talking about it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reporter Chad Sokol updated this story on Friday, Nov. 17, 2017, to",
