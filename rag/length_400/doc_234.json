NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The leaders in the negotiations — Senator Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent, and Representative Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican — plan to outline the agreement at a news conference Monday afternoon.

Both the House and Senate had previously passed bills that were largely for emergency relief, and the acting veterans secretary, Sloan D. Gibson, had also said that $17.6 billion would be needed over the next three years to meet current demand and hire 10,000 clinicians, acquire new locations to treat patients and upgrade the department’s information technology systems.
