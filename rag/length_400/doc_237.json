NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two had been dating for the past 18 months, Pinto said, about six months after his wife, Nanette, filed for legal separation. Nanette and the couple’s two teenage daughters were in Australia at the time of his death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Clara County Coroner’s Office said an autopsy was performed Monday on Kinkade but the cause of death might not be determined for months. Results of toxicology and other tests could take 12 to 20 weeks, because of a backup at the county lab. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The fact that he’s famous has nothing to do with the toxicology turnaround time,” said a spokeswoman from the coroner’s office who didn’t want her name used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent years, bouts with alcohol and bankruptcy painted a darker image of the man who described himself as the “painter of light.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was known for his paintings of bucolic pastoral scenes and charming cottages, candlelit images made into calendars and decorative plates that are said to fill one in 20 homes in California. Although the fine-art world often derided his work as tacky, mainstream Americans flocked to his paintings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kinkade created several hundred Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries to sell his work. In 2010, the recession took its toll and his Morgan Hill art company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing nearly $6.2 million in creditors’ claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the CEO of Kinkade’s galleries said in a statement they were overwhelmed by the “outpouring of appreciation and interest in Thom’s work.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He strived to make his paintings available and affordable to the public and his collectors,” John Hasting, CEO of The Thomas Kinkade Co., said Monday. “In his honor, we will continue his legacy and do what we can to carry on. The man is already greatly missed by the Kinkade extended family, but we want everyone to know that the galleries will remain open and his images will continue to be marketed worldwide, just as he would have wanted it.”",
