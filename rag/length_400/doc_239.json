NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The media, Conway said, has “this obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.” Conway blamed that obsession for the uproar that began over the weekend when Trump hurled a political attack across the Atlantic, writing online that there had been “at least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The quote selected by Trump was a misleading one.

Instead, she pointed to the president’s repeated interactions with British Prime Minister Theresa May and his remarks at the Ford’s Theatre Annual Gala, where he declared that “this bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “So we've got the 23rd ISIS-inspired or -directed attack taking innocent lives, children in Manchester, children in Nice and we want to know — we want to put some blameworthiness here",
