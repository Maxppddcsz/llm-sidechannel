NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only CBS4’s cameras were there as nearly a dozen Doral police and code officers raided the Pink Pony Gentleman’s Club Tuesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have illegal activity involving underaged persons, that’s the extent of the allegation that we’re putting forth at this time because it is an ongoing investigation,” said Lt. Carlos Arango with the Doral Police Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One person, Jose Manuel Arguelles, was arrested in connection with the case. Arguelles is accused of bringing his 16-year-old daughter and her 16-year-old friend to the club on several occasions. While inside, according to the police report, the minors were drinking and snorting cocaine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mother of a 16-year old girl gave CBS4’s Ted Scouten a video which she says is her daughter inside, hanging out with an underage friend and that friend’s father who she says is Arguelles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s drugs involved. There’s minors. My daughter is only 16 and his daughter is 16, so we had no idea this man would be capable of bringing his own daughter there,” said the mother who did not want to identify herself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she came across the video and pictures of the girls over the weekend and was shocked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The things on the videos, I could describe it as disgusting. An adult has a choice to make his decisions with his own life, but you don’t do that with minors. You don’t distort their future because of your addictions,” said the mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arguelles is now charged with child neglect, giving drugs to children and sexual performance by a child. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the pictures shows a 16-year old girl on a pole with a stripper. Arguelles’ attorney Chris Mancini argued about that in bond court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Judge look, I know this is serious, but dancing on a stripper pole is not simulated sexual intercourse, not deviant sexual intercourse,” said Mancini. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement his attorney said, “This case was not as serious as it appeared to be given the State’s overcharging my client with eight counts of Promoting Sexual Performance by a Child since no facts supporting the ‘sexual performance’ component of that charge were presented in court.” since was",
