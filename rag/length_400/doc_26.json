Now conditions are so grim that the UN has turned to a word it uses sparingly and specifically – famine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yesterday the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) declared that a famine exists in two regions of southern Somalia, and warned that the famine could soon spread to the rest of southern Somalia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While many countries worldwide face food security crises, with large numbers of people hungry and unable to find enough food, only rarely do the conditions meet the humanitarian community’s formal criteria for a famine.
