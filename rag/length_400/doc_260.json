NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An uptight architect and a needy actor are forced to take a road trip together. With Robert Downey Jr., Zach Galifianakis. Director: Todd Phillips (1:40). Rated R: Language, drug use, violence, sexuality. At area theaters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those hoping for another \"Hangover\" may be disappointed by Todd Phillips' punch-drunk followup, which is basically \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" for the road-rage generation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert Downey Jr. is simmering straight man Peter, an architect who's on edge from the moment he meets Zach Galifianakis's flaky Ethan at the Atlanta airport. Peter is heading home to L.A. for the impending birth of his child, while aspiring actor Ethan is determined to guest-star on his favorite show, \"Two and a Half Men.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ethan's antics get them both kicked off the plane, though Peter's wallet remains on board. If he wants to get to California before his wife goes into labor, he'll have to hitch a ride with Ethan. Peter's already fighting to keep his temper in check, but he has no idea how bad things are going to get. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are several laughs along the way, often courtesy of cameos from the likes of RZA, Danny McBride and Jamie Foxx. (Michelle Monaghan is given virtually nothing to do as Peter's pregnant wife.) And a couple of the set pieces, like the guys' disastrous detour into Mexico, are close to inspired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But you'll need a far higher tolerance lever than Peter if you're going to make it all the way across the country with the obscenely irritating Ethan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Galifianakis does make an effort to find Ethan's vulnerable side, but Phillips prefers to keep it hidden beneath grating tics and obvious jokes (he wears a Lilith Fair T-shirt and couldn't be prouder of his recent perm). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Galifianakis commits to the absurdity with impressive dedication, Downey seems atypically uncomfortable through most of the movie. Honestly, it's hard to blame him. Like the direction, the script -- written by Phillips and three others -- veers all over the place before reaching its inevitable, unsurprising destination. to stars makes does Zach if prouder needy with",
