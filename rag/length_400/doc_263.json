NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We think that Black Friday has gotten out of hand,\" said Jerry Stritzke, CEO of the chain that specializes in outdoor and fitness gear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American retailers have been pushing \"door busters\" earlier and earlier, dragging employees in to open stores on Thanksgiving afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But this year, REI's 12,000 full and part-time workers will not only have Thanksgiving Day off, they will have Black Friday off with pay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stritzke acknowledged that keeping REI's 143 U.S. stores closed will put a dent in revenue. He said Black Friday has been among the company's top 10 sales days in past years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When you close...on one of the busiest days of the year, it's going to cost you money,\" he told CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This business centers [on] the outdoors,\" he said. \"Thus, we can do something like close our doors on Black Friday, and we'll have the membership that'll think that's cool.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stritzke said that it's more valuable for REI to bring in new, passionate members than to compete for holiday bargain hunters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You need people to go to the mountain, you need people to catch that outdoor bug,\" Stritzke said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That mantra has worked for REI. With 5.5 million members, it's the nation's largest retail co-op and has seen two years of double-digit growth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is a lot of disruptive forces in retail.
