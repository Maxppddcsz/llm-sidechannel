NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is the only known recorded interview in which the celebrated author discussed the book and her newfound success as an author, according to the UCLA Library, and one of the last interviews she gave the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “My reaction was not one of surprise,” Lee told Newquist when he asked how she felt about the book’s immediate acclaim. “It was one of sheer numbness. … I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of reviewers, but at the same time I sort of hoped someone would like it well enough to give me encouragement.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While a transcript of Lee’s interview on Newquist’s radio show “Counterpoint” was published in one of the radio host’s books, this is the first time the audio recording could be made publicly accessible, following Lee’s death on Friday at age 89. Before that took place, only scholars were allowed access to the recording in Special Collections.

There is something decent to be said for it, and there’s something to lament when it goes, and it’s going. It’s passing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In other words, all I want to be is the Jane Austen of South Alabama,” Lee told Newquist.
