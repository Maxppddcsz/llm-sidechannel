NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you missed the relatively short \"Black Jeopardy!\" sketch, which didn't get as much attention as the presidential debate satire, take seven minutes to change that. Hilarious, sharp, and topical, it's the best comedic take on the current presidential election we've seen on TV this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Black Jeopardy!\" has showed up on \"SNL\" before, usually playing up the cultural differences of contestants in a battle of stereotypes. That's true here, but in a Donald Trump-inspired way: Tom Hanks is the sole white contestant on the game show, wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it turns out as the sketch goes on that the black contestants and host and the white Trump supporter have a lot in common: a distrust of authority and elections, a love of curvy women and Tyler Perry films, and an ability to get a good deal from their local \"guy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The delirious, cleverly written sketch insists that we're more alike than different as Americans. Until, that is, the biting final moment, when the final category shows up: \"Lives That Matter.\" The black contestants look at Hanks' Trump voter awkwardly, and he stares silently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was good while it lasted,\" Kenan Thompson's host says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sketch, written by \"Weekend Update\" co-anchor Michael Che and \"SNL\" co-head writer Bryan Tucker, leaves us to imagine what Hanks' character thinks about which lives matter, but it's a pointed jab at how class and race play important — and sometimes very different — roles in shaping attitudes and beliefs around the current presidential election, in which Trump has amassed support among working-class whites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interestingly, the sketch also has fans broadly among political thinkers and writers. Fox News contributor Stacey Dash approves: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As does a former Jeb Bush campaign staffer: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Slate political writer Jamelle Bouie had some thoughts about the sketch's meaning: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the Washington Post summed it up by calling it \"SNL's best political sketch this year.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch the full sketch below: the debate staffer: of NEWLINE_CHAR women moment, take was NEWLINE_CHAR the sketch",
