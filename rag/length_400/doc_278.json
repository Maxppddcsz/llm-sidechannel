NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorneys for Williams’s widow, Susan Schneider, and his three children from previous marriages, squared off in probate court in San Francisco on Monday and agreed to private mediation, hoping to settle a dispute regarding the contents of his estate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schneider and Williams’s children — Zachary, Zelda and Cody — have disagreed over who can claim certain the contents of the couple’s Tiburon, California, home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams’s will entitles his children to clothing, jewelry, personal photos taken prior to his marriage to Schneider, as well as awards, memorabilia and tangible personal property from his home, where he was found dead last August. Schneider argues that Williams’s will entitles her to certain items, such as his watches and other personal effects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the hearing, which lasted less than 40 minutes, both sides agreed to meet informally in the next two weeks to arrange a pick-up of various items at the Williams’s home and to have a private mediation before late April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Schneider and the children were eager to end the stand-off and to keep their personal information out of the public spotlight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrew Bassak, attorney for Williams’s children, told PEOPLE after the court hearing, “We didn’t want any publicity.” Jim Wagstaffe, Schneider’s attorney agreed, saying, “The trustees and the children do not want this to become public. We are interested in getting it resolved as quickly as possible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think we can have all the undisputed items picked up in the next two weeks,” Wagstaffe said, adding, “We could probably do it as early as today.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He claimed, “[Schneider and the children] will meet in good faith within the next two weeks,” and said “a large percentage of these items are not disputed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wagstaffe told the court that his client would like to keep her wedding presents, the tux Williams wore to the wedding and photographs from his 60th birthday in 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Bassak appeared less optimistic that the dispute could be settled so quickly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t know and I can’t speculate,” Bassak told PEOPLE when asked if he agreed with Wagstaffe’s timeline, adding, “There is still a lot to be worked out.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —Reporting by",
