Obey me, for I am the wind’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The atmosphere of Fifties Naples has captured the imagination of millions via Elena Ferrante’s luminous quartet of novels about two girls growing up in a poor neighbourhood, published in English to feverish acclaim over the past few years. Her compatriot Erri de Luca – author of over 50 books, many outselling Ferrante in Italian – traverses similar terrain in this 2009 novel, following a young orphan’s life in a Neapolitan apartment block “full of walled-up trapdoors, secret passageways, crimes and passions”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unlike Ferrante’s epic saga, De Luca’s novel – his first to be translated into English – is concise and elliptical. It starts in our unnamed narrator’s childhood, but swiftly jumps to a heady period when he is 17. Nicknamed “the monkey” for his agile retrieval of stray footballs, the watchful boy lives alone, cared for by the porter Don Gaetano, a sage-like figure who claims he can read people’s thoughts. Over games of cards, Don Gaetano regales the orphan with tales of Second World War resistance: how he tried to sustain a Jewish man who spent the summer of 1943 hiding in a storeroom while above tanks ploughed through shops and Jews were sold to the police. Undetonated bombs, the boy learns, still stud Naples, subterranean relics of a dark past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wartime is richly evoked, but the other strand of the plot, a love story, is less affecting. As a child, the boy was fascinated by a girl he had seen only through a third-floor window. After a decade, she returns to the building. Their ensuing passion is ripe with overblown dialogue (“ ‘Anna, an eternity has passed.’ ‘It’s over. Time begins now, and will last only moments.’ ” “ ‘Can I kiss you?’ ‘No. You’re pollen. Obey me, for I am the wind.’ ”). Anna is mad, it turns out, which explains her mysterious disappearance; beyond that, her condition is never properly explored. Naples itself – simmering with rage and corruption – is the most memorable character in this slightly disjointed novel.
