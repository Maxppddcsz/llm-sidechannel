NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As WikiLeaks and its leader Julian Assange face mounting legal issues, key members of the project are reportedly jumping ship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Swedish news site DN.se, the new project, dubbed Openleaks, is going to launch Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An insider told DN.se, “The two organizations are similar in that aspect that both are focusing on providing means for whistleblowers to anonymously provide the public with information.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where the two services will differ, it appears, is both from a management and publishing perspective.

In that aspect, it is quite interesting to see how little of politicians’ anger seems directed at the newspapers using WikiLeaks sources.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the one hand, yes, simply acting as a broker of sensitive information may constitute less legal or political pressures for an organization. On the other hand, it raises important questions about what kinds of organizations are allowed to access the system and how that access is determined.
