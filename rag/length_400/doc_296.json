Hannity has put Republican U.S. Senate candidate... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity ultimately said Wednesday he couldn't be the judge of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was an odd conclusion to a televised ultimatum. Hannity, whose words carry weight among conservatives because of his large nightly audience, had given Moore 24 hours to explain \"inconsistencies\" in his response to allegations of child molestation or quit the Alabama race.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two panelists on Hannity's Fox News show Monday, Jeanine Pirro and Geraldo Rivera, both said they could no longer support Moore.
