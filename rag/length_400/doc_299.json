Titled \"Freedom,\" after her song of the same name with Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé wrote, \"We are sick and tired of the killings of young men and women in our communities. It is up to us to take a stand and demand that they 'stop killing us.' We don't need sympathy. We need everyone to respect our lives. We're going to stand up as a community and fight against anyone who believes that murder or any violent action by those who are sworn to protect us should consistently go unpunished. These robberies of lives make us feel helpless and hopeless but we have to believe that we are fighting for the rights of the next generation, for the next young men and women who believe in good. This is a human right. No matter your race, gender or sexual orientation. This is a fight for anyone who feels marginalized, who is struggling for freedom and human rights. This is not a plea to all police officers but toward any human being who fails to value life. The war on people of color and all minorities needs to be over. Fear is not an excuse. Hate will not win.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We all have the power to channel our anger and frustration into action. We must use our voices to contact the politicians and legislators in our districts and demand social and judicial changes,\" Beyoncé, 34, continued. \"While we pray for the families of Alton Sterling and Philander Castile, we will also pray for an end to this plague of injustice in our communities. We all have the power to channel our anger and frustration into action. We must use our voices to contact the politicians and legislators in our districts and demand social and judicial changes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The singer ended her letter by sharing links to help people contact their local congressman or congresswoman, as well as to voice protest for Sterling and Castile's homicides.

After she performed \"Freedom\" a cappella, she and her dancers held a moment of silence in front of a screen that listed many of the hundreds of victims'",
