NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Late Show host is in Russia on assignment for a future broadcast of his CBS late-night series, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Late Show is in repeats Thursday and Friday, no doubt coinciding with his trip. Colbert is due to return to the Late Show desk for a new episode Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Colbert tweeted photo of himself in the country Thursday in response to a tweet by President Donald Trump in which the president acknowledged he did not have any tapes on ousted FBI director James Comey as he had previously seemed to hint at. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR .@realDonaldTrump Don't worry, Mr. President. I'm in Russia. If the \"tapes\" exist, I'll bring you back a copy! pic.twitter.com/v5flvAMtFY â€” Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) June 22, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Colbert is the latest of several TV personalities to head to Russia in recent months. Megyn Kelly traveled there earlier in June for an interview with Russian leader Vladimir Putin for her new NBC newsmagazine show. Russia has been under scrutiny in recent months for its alleged connections to the president and specifically the allegations that Russia somehow tampered with the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Oliver traveled to Russia prior to Trump's election victory, in 2015, to interview NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time Colbert has traveled for The Late Show. He did a week of live episodes from Philadelphia and Cleveland for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in 2016. Colbert has increasingly leaned in to more political coverage, which he used to cover aggressively on his former Comedy Central show The Colbert Report and before that on The Daily Show. He did a live special for Showtime the night of the election and also did a live broadcast of The Late Show on the day of Trump's inauguration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Travel has become a bigger trend across the late-night board. James Corden traveled to his native London earlier this month; Seth Meyers did a week of Late Night from Washington, D.C., in 2016; Andy Cohen recently filmed a series of Watch What Happens Live episodes from Los Angeles; and Jimmy Kimmel has filmed several weeks of shows from Brooklyn during his ABC tenure. However, no one has more passport stamps than Conan O'Brien, who has filmed his TBS show",
