NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SEE ALSO: Annnnd another Fox News host just blasted Donald Trump NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York magazine reporter and former Roger Ailes nemesis Gabriel Sherman reported on the change on Wednesday but notes the decision was actually made last year, not long after Ailes was forced out of his role as CEO and chairman of the network over mounting sexual harassment allegations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Confirming the move as an attempt to distance the network from the now-deceased Ailes, one exec told Sherman the \"Fair and Balanced\" slogan, coined by Ailes and used since the network's 1996 launch, was \"too closely associated with Roger.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The slogan has been synonymous with the 24-hour news channel since its inception, even as critics have used the phrase ironically thanks to personalities (like Sean Hannity) and shows (like Fox & Friends) that hardly follow that rule. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An insider close to the matter told Mashable that while the slogan was no longer being used for on-air promotions and other external marketing, the phrase is still something of an editorial mantra—host Bret Baier still closes his show with it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Sherman, the network will be pushing another slogan — “Most Watched. Most Trusted\" — from now on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's also worth noting that this isn't the only slogan that Fox has moved on from, indicating that the changes were part of a larger overhaul in the post-Ailes era. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fox News also stopped using We Report, You Decide in marketing material almost a year ago. — Joe Flint (@JBFlint) June 14, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So while the move isn't breaking news, that didn't keep those critical of the network from weighing in.
