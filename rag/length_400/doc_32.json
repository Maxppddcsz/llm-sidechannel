NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not content to have the highest-grossing store on the world’s most expensive street, Apple is set to open a gargantuan retail outlet inside Grand Central Terminal, the massive train station in the heart of Manhattan, according to a new report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rumors of the deal have been circulating for a few days, but Apple sleuth Leander Kahney says he’s confirmed that Apple will be opening the store sometime in the fall, most likely in early September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If true, I think it’s fair to say that this deal would represent a vote of confidence in New York City’s economic recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would also reflect a change in the nature of Grand Central, a beloved, 140-year-old landmark on 42nd Street, turning it from essentially a transit point — albeit a gorgeous one — with scattered retail, into a full-fledged shopping destination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move would help alleviate the immense traffic at Apple’s flagship store on Fifth Avenue. For years now, it’s been increasingly difficult to do business there in a timely way, except for late at night. On weekends and over holidays, the store is virtually impassible, clogged by throngs of tourists from around the globe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kahney says the outlet will become the largest Apple retail location in the world and be called Apple Store, Grand Central. At present, the largest Apple store is the Covent Garden location in London, which measures in at 16,732 square feet of publicly accessible space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last time I checked, there wasn’t a 16,000 square-foot chunk of unoccupied retail space inside Grand Central, through which 700,000 people — mostly commuters — travel each weekday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, and this is pure speculation, one possible candidate could be the retail spaces surrounding and below Vanderbilt Hall, the huge room on the 42nd Street side that used to be the station’s waiting area. It’s currently used for seasonal events, art shows, etc. (Wall Street bank Bear Stearns once set up a squash court there). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s the leasing plan [.pdf] via Kahney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reached for comment, an Apple spokesperson told Wired.com: “We have not made any announcements about a store at that location. Anything else is rumor and speculation.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow us for disruptive tech news: Sam Gustin and Epicenter on Twitter.
