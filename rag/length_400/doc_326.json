Torralva of the Caller-Times NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six Miss Corpus Christi Latina pageant contestants are suing the contest's director after the crown went to a woman whose past they say should have disqualified her from competing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caitlin Cifuentes, 25, was crowned queen June 11 and is slated to compete for the state title in August. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit argues Cifuentes' criminal record and previous marriage disqualified her from competing according to the contract contestants were required to sign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cifuentes, who could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday, is currently on deferred adjudicated probation for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and probation for a misdemeanor driving while intoxicated case, according to online Nueces County court records. In a Facebook post celebrating her victory she acknowledged the controversy surrounding her win saying she worked hard and earned the crown. She is not named as a defendant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuits seeks $100,000 from pageant director Kayla Alvarez, who is accused of allowing Cifuentes to compete despite disqualifying factors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Kayla Alvarez willfully and knowingly violated countless terms of the contractual agreement by allowing Caitlin Cifuentes to participate in and ultimately win the pageant,\" the lawsuit states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first-year pageant director told the Caller-Times she hasn't received legal notice of the lawsuit but defended the pageant judges' selection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Just because you have a bad background ... doesn't mean that should hold you back from accomplishing your goals,\" Alvarez said. \"She's worked very hard and the judges saw that and she won fair and square.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alvarez said she has no plans to renounce Cifuentes' crown. She said Cifuentes' record doesn't disqualify her because deferred adjudication probation is not legally a conviction. And while the pageant prohibits girls who have been married from competing in the teen category, it does not prohibit divorced women from the adult competition, Alvarez said. However, the contestants may not be married at the time of the pageant, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit also states funds from ticket sales are supposed to be given to the Women's Shelter of South Texas. Frances Wilson, the agency's CEO, told the Caller-Times they have not received the money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alvarez said she's waiting for some of the contestants to turn in their ticket money.
