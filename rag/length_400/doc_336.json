NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experimenting with new shipping techniques! A photo posted by Ship Snow Yo (Kyle Waring) (@shipsnowyo) on Feb 8, 2015 at 7:46am PST NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sidewalks are too narrow, the T is too slow, and appreciation for the Winterfell that Boston has become is quickly wearing off. So one guy came up with a simple answer: take the snow, and put it someplace else. That’s the general idea of ‘Ship Snow, Yo,’ a startup created by Kyle Waring—ship the snow out of the Northeast, one water bottle at a time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, the water bottles are the original concept. Ship Snow, Yo is exporting bits of Boston’s historic snow inside 16.9 ounces of plastic—which Waring freezes in dry ice—to friends, family and enemies in warm, sunny quarters for one payment of $19.99. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The original product was a joke to really just make light of a bad situation with us just getting dumped on up here,” Waring tells Boston. “We ran a couple of tests to start to see if the snow would actually arrive.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The snow is packed and shipped using two-day shipping, hoping that the snow will arrive at its destination without melting. So far, 98 water bottles have been shipped—that’s 670,464 snowflakes, according to Ship Snow, Yo’s website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the next few days, however, he plans to launch a new model. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m moving away from driving dry ice,” says Waring. “I’m using Styrofoam and then wrapping the snow in tinfoil.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But there’s more! He’ll also be sending a pound and a half at a time, costing between $80 and $100. But it’s more likely to arrive just as fluffy and annoying as it left. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mind that Waring doesn’t make any guarantees. His website warns that your snow might arrive as water, and there’s no refund policy after snow has shipped—a fool proof method for making sure it stays out of Boston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But those who receive the snow, Waring says, are generally happy to see it. Who would have thought? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They understand that we want to clean up Boston, so even if it does arrive as water, they get a kick out",
