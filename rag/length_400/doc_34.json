Keats' new project, the Millennium Camera, is designed to capture images over the course of 1,000 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In our era of instant digital photos and disposable everything, conceptual artist Jonathon Keats has decided to slow things down. Way down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, Keats unveiled his new Millennium Camera installation -- a pinhole camera designed to track changes in the Arizona skyline over the next 1,000 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The project is literally an exponential expansion of his previous Century Camera project, which deployed cameras made for 100-year exposures in several cities around the world.

In other words, the photographs will show how our future climate transforms our terrestrial habitat.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exhibit will be installed on the museum’s third-level terrace, where museum visitors will be able to see both the device itself, and the skyline view of Tempe, Arizona, which the camera will capture with deep time focus.
