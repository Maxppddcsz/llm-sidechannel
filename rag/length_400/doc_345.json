NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pearl Moen, who was 17-years-old at the time of the attack, hid in the bushes and attacked a woman because she wanted to know what it would feel like to kill someone, according to diary entries found in her home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the diary, she goes on to call herself a “homicidal psychopath with a deep hatred towards people.” The diary also had a drawing of a male and female lying in a blanket on the sidewalk which, according to police, was exactly what the victim and a male friend were doing just prior to the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I always thought she would walk around with guilt, but knowing she had this joy and this pride is very unsettling,” said the victim, a 23-year-old nurse, who spoke with KXAN after Moen was charged with Attempted Murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a release by Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore, Moen had a history of drug use and psychological issues, but no previous criminal record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victim addressed Moen at her sentencing, saying she was “glad the defendant stabbed her rather than a child, an elderly person or someone who could not defend themselves.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victim also said her background in the medical field allowed her to save her own life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pearl Moen’s diary entry: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “So, okay I’ll start with the exciting bit. I stabbed an innocent woman to death earlier today (well yesterday since it’s 1 a.m.)…It was absolutely fantastic. Murder gives me a high unlike any other, it feels like this crisp unreality, flashing and sparkling, adrenaline and shock. Fight or flight mode. How do I even go about describing it. The whole thing was unreal. I’m so proud of myself. I stabbed her like 20 times. Maybe more…She screamed and grabbed at me, saying ‘What the [expletive]?! Help! Leave!’ For now I should explain why. Other than the fact that I’m a homicidal psychopath. I have a deep hatred towards people right now..Yesterday I lost my other gold ring I’ve worn all my life on a chain around my neck as it was ripped off by a girl",
