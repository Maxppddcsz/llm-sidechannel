(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CAESAREA, Israel (AP) â€” A chance discovery by two divers uncovered Israel's biggest find of underwater Roman-era artifacts in three decades, archaeologists said Monday as the priceless objects were showcased for the first time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The treasures were found last month by divers Ran Feinstein and Ofer Raanan when they came across an ancient shipwreck near the port of Caesarea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standing next to his diving buddy, Raanan recounted the moment the pair realized they had discovered something special.

Some scientists believe it is located on a geological fault line; other theories point to a tsunami.
