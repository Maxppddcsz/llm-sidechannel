And I think positive in this way, they freeze the program in place.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The deal, he said, is a “very good foundation as a backdrop against which to have comprehensive negotiations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Sunday Shows in 90 seconds: Iran, NSA, Obamacare) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think it's a very solid achievement by Secretary [of State John] Kerry and President Obama and the administration,” Donilon said. “And, again, I think a very solid basis on which to go forward.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Host George Stephanopoulos also asked Donilon to address President Barack Obama’s standing with other world leaders in the wake of the deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You know, one of the things we've seen though is that it has created a lot of upset, not only in Israel, but also among some other allies in the Middle East, like Saudi Arabia,” Stephanopoulos said. “And it feeds into a general perception among some of our adversaries, like Vladimir Putin, like the Saudis, that the president has been vacillating and weak. How do you respond to that?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don't see how in this case you can call the president vacillating and weak,” Donilon replied. “I mean, how did we get here with respect to Iran? We got here through a U.S.-led, very tough isolation and pressure campaign.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is a direct line here between the sanctions, [Hassan] Rouhani's election, and their coming to the table,” he said. “Why? Because we put tremendous pressure on the Iranian economy. We've also isolated the Iranians politically. And we've had a fairly major defense build-up in the region to indicate to the Iranians that all options are on the table.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a result of the “U.S. pressure campaign to bring the Iranians to the table,” he said. And “the test now is whether or not the Iranians can do the things they need to do to assure the United States and international community they don't have a dangerous program.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more about: Iran, Tom Donilon Former and ABC’s",
