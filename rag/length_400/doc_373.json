NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amazon is developing two new smartphones as well as an audio streaming device, which we assume would be like an iPod. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previously, there was a report Amazon was developing a video streaming box that rivals Apple TV and Roku. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If all of these reports are accurate, Amazon is going to have quite the suite of hardware products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the two smartphones Amazon is developing will reportedly have a 3D screen that can track your eye movements. The 3D screen on this high-end smartphone would not require glasses. Images would appear to float on the screen like a hologram, says Bensinger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You never want to pre-judge a product that doesn't exist, but this sounds really bad. It sounds like a mess of horrendous gimmicks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no value in a 3D screen. HTC made a phone with a 3D screen, the EVO 3D. It didn't come out with a second 3D phone, which tells you all you need to know. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When HTC failed to follow with a second 3D phone, an HTC rep explained the decision to CNET, saying, \"I wouldn't say 3D was necessarily dead, I mean never say never, but we don't have any new products with 3D in the lineup. That's based partially on customer feedback, what we know the market wants, and also a design decision we've made.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for eye-tracking, Samsung is trying that and it's not working. Amazon has failed to produce great software, so we see little-to-no chance that its going to do good eye tracking software. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The smartphone market is very crowded. Amazon understandbly wants to roll out a smartphone that stands out from the crowd. 3D screens and eye tracking are not the best way to stand out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Amazon really wants to do something great with the smartphone it should focus on data plan pricing. If it could radically cut consumers' monthly cell phone bills it would have a winner.
