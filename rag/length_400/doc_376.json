First Casey Anthony gets off, now there’s been a mistrial declared in the Roger Clemens Congressional perjury case just days after the trial started. Why? Because the government violated a pretrial order. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Updates after the jump…. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ABC News has the report: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Judge Reggie Walton halted proceedings this morning over complaints from the defense about prosecutors’ use of information the judge had banned, quickly accepted their concerns and then declared a mistrial. The defense had complained that prosecutors had not followed a pretrial ruling to limit information about conversations fellow ballplayer Andy Pettitte had with his wife about the use of human growth hormone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seriously guys? Pettitte was talking to his wife and you used the conversation anyway after the judge specifically told you not to? Does the government need a first year law student to come in and tell them about hearsay or something? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Boston Globe reports that Judge Walton was really angry at the government lawyers: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In angry comments directed toward the prosecution, Walton said, “Government counsel doesn’t do just what government counsel can get away with doing …I’m very troubled by this. A lot of government money has been used to reach this point. The government should have been more cautious. I don’t see how I can un-ring the bell.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We’ll have a lot of non-lawyers reading this post trying to figure out just how boneheaded a move this was from the government lawyers. On a bonehead scale of one to ten, with a one being signing Pedro Feliciano when you just saw his arm get pitched off on the other side of town, and a ten being the Barry Zito contract, I’d rate this mistake at a level 9. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s the legal equivalent of throwing a broken bat at a player in the middle of a World Series game and then being surprised when people accuse you of having ‘roid rage. The government has spent how many dollars trying to bring Clemens to justice? I guess they’re about to waste more money trying to catch the Rocket.
