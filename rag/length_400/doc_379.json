NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It contained a postcard dated May 17th, 1913 written by a man named Richard Platz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The modest Danish postcard had two German stamps on it and a polite message asking the finder to send it on to his address in Berlin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holger von Neuhoff of the International Maritime Museum in Hamburg said: \"This is certainly the first time such an old message in a bottle was found, particularly with the bottle intact.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers then set to work identifying the author and managed to track down his 62-year-old granddaughter Angela Erdmann, who lives in Berlin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was almost unbelievable,\" Erdmann told news agency DPA. She was first able to hold the brown bottle last week at the Hamburg museum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside was a message on a postcard requesting the finder to return it to his home address in Berlin. \"That was a pretty moving moment,\" Erdmann said. \"Tears rolled down my cheeks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Von Neuhoff said researchers were able to determine based on the address that it was 20-year-old baker's son Richard Platz who threw the bottle in the Baltic while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Berlin-based genealogical researcher then located Erdmann, who never knew Platz, her mother's father who died in 1946 at the age of 54. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Von Neuhoff said a handwriting comparison with letters penned by Platz later in life confirmed that he was \"without a doubt\" the author. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Erdmann told local newspapers that the surprise discovery had inspired her to look through family scrapbooks to learn more about her grandfather, a Social Democrat who liked to read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much of the ink on the postcard has been rendered illegible with time and dampness, von Neuhoff said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery will be on display at the museum until May 1st, after which experts will set to work trying to decipher the rest of the message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Guinness World Records had previously identified the oldest message in a bottle as dating from 1914. It spent nearly 98 years at sea before being fished from the water.
