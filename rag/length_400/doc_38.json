NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While better known for its work in hotel development, it is expected that Lam will maintain the properties scattered across Manhattan as apartments and convert others to luxury homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These are core investment properties, they just have great rates of return so you can sit there rent and manage them,” said Christopher Okada, president and owner of Okada and Company LLC, who represented The Lam Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the first transaction, Regal sold the 30-unit, mixed-use building at 21-23 Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan for $14.5 million. The buyer was listed in city records as YJL Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of The Lam Group based at 202 Centre Street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nine-story, 37,800 s/f building has a total of 30 apartment units, all rented at open market rents, and 4,300 s/f of ground floor retail occupied by food chains, Papa John’s and Subway.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Broker Jasper Socia, president of Independent Properties NYC, Inc. who represented Laboz in the sale, said the new owner plans to keep the property as a rental.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lam plans to convert the office and retail spaces, totaling some 32,000 s/f, into condominium residential units, according to Okada. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, Laboz also sold 3 East 17th Street, a two-story retail property in Flatiron district, for $4.4m. The Lam Group will reconfigure and renovate the 5,400 s/f building to create ground floor retail with a three-bedroom apartment above. Okada said the cap rate for the property made the investment “like finding a gem in the sewer.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Socia, a former Bond NY broker who founded his own firm earlier this year, is currently marketing approximately 50,000 s/f of residential and commercial properties.
