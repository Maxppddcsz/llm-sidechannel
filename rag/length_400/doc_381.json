NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kaling Wald, 50, pleaded guilty to failing to notify police that her husband had died, an offense under the provincial Coroner's Act, and was sentenced on Monday to probation and counseling, her lawyer told Reuters on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Wald, 52, died in March 2013 of what authorities believe were natural causes following a foot infection linked to his diabetes, defense lawyer Peter Boushy said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His wife Kaling Wald left him in bed and sealed up the bedroom in their Hamilton, Ontario, home to prevent the odor of decomposition from disturbing the busy household, which included five of the couple's six children, as well as other adults living in the home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Just as Jesus raised Lazarus after the fourth day, so too did she believe God would resurrect her husband in due time,\" said Boushy. The family was active in Christian street ministry and outreach in Hamilton, an industrial city about 70 kms southwest of Toronto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There clearly was an over-exuberance of one's faith,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The corpse was discovered in September 2013 when the local sheriff arrived to evict the family after they defaulted on the mortgage. It had attracted rodents and was badly decomposed, but the family had packed his things in preparation for the eviction and did not attempt to conceal the corpse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Children's Aid Society investigated the family after the discovery of the corpse, but found no concerns and the case was closed, documents showed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boushy said his client now understands what the law required and would not do the same thing again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She certainly was remorseful, and definitely was teary-eyed,\" he said. \"Indeed, she noted that she was never actually able to cry over the passing of her husband, but this seemed to have been an emotional breakthrough after the court proceedings yesterday. I think counseling is certainly going to be beneficial for her.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Reporting by Andrea Hopkins.
