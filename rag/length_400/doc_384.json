NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a study in the British Journal of Psychiatry, researchers analyzed comedians from Australia, Britain and the United States and found they scored significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The traits included a tendency towards impulsive or anti-social behavior, and a tendency to avoid intimacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis - both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,\" said Gordon Claridge of the University of Oxford's department of experimental psychology, who led the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the traits in question are known as \"psychotic\", Claridge said, they can also represent healthy equivalents of features such as moodiness, social introversion and the tendency to lateral thinking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Although schizophrenic psychosis itself can be detrimental to humor, in its lesser form it can increase people's ability to associate odd or unusual things or to think 'outside the box',\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The traits scored were \"unusual experiences\", such as belief in telepathy and paranormal events, \"cognitive disorganization\" such as difficulty in focusing thoughts, \"introvertive anhedonia\" - reduced ability to feel social and physical pleasure, and \"impulsive non-conformity\", or tendency towards impulsive, antisocial behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The same questionnaire was also completed by 364 actors - who are also used to performing in front of an audience - as a control group, and the comedians' and actors' results were compared to each other as well as a general group of 831 people who had non-creative jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers found that comedians scored significantly higher on all four types of psychotic personality traits compared to the general group. Most striking were their high scores for impulsive non-conformity and introverted personality traits, the researchers said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actors scored",
