Though tweets from McCarthy had suggested bad blood behind the GG scenes, Sherman-Palladino said there was \"nothing malicious going on.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Actually, Sherman-Palladino explained, she hadn't mapped out a big role for McCarthy in the reboot, because she assumed the star would be too busy to spend weeks on set. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’d say [to Netflix], ‘Look, we know you didn’t hear a Melissa McCarthy arc in here because we are not naïve enough to think we’re going to be able to grab her for 60 days of shooting... I’ve been told by her people for months, 'Can’t happen. Can’t happen. Can’t happen.’\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, she offered up a last-ditch offer for McCarthy to make her return. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We’ve just put it out in the universe: We’re here until May 10,\" she said. \"I know what the scene is. I’ll pre-light it for her. She can drive up, run in, shoot it, and run out. I can get her in and out in two hours.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Success! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's a magic risotto miracle. Sookie is back!
