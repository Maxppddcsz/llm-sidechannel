Also, Comcast customers can adjust their settings for notifications via email, browser or text when they reach thresholds like 50, 70, 85 or 125 percent of the cap. The third time it's exceeded within a 12 month period, however, the \"courtesy months\" go away and users will be charged $10 for an additional 50GB of data, which will continue happening to a limit of $200 per month.

Just how fair that really is, depends on your perspective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Netflix has called on the FCC to fix \"unreasonable\" caps, but it referenced limits of just 300GB per month. The commission is looking into caps and zero rating, but at least for now, this is the reality for the majority of Comcast's home internet customers. buy them connections, your majority FAQ, streaming is unlimited will or will the",
