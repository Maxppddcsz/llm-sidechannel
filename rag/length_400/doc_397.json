NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The footage posted to SnapChat shows several Churchill High School students playing jump rope with what appears to be the intestines of a dissected cat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can watch the videos here and here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cat was reportedly being used in the students' anatomy class.
