NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CATHOLIC NEWS AGENCY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After emergency responders spent an hour trying to remove a young woman from her wrecked car near Center, Mo., a priest appeared with anointing oil and prayed with her, and then inexplicably vanished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He came up and approached the patient and offered a prayer,” Raymond Reed, the New London, Mo., fire chief explained to KHQA-TV about the Aug. 4 incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A sense of calmness came over her, and it did us as well. I can’t be for certain how it was said, but myself and another firefighter, we very plainly heard that we should remain calm, that our tools would now work and that we would get her out of that vehicle.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once the victim, Katie Lentz, was removed from her car and put into an Air Evac helicopter, the emergency responders wanted to thank the priest, but he had disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two-lane Missouri state highway on which the crash occurred had been blocked off for a quarter of a mile throughout Lentz’ rescue, barring bystanders and nearby vehicles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lentz’ older-model Mercedes was struck by another car that had passed into her lane. That car’s driver has been charged with DWI. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rescue workers spent an hour trying to get Lentz out of her car, but the solid materials of its construction were dulling the fire department’s emergency equipment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lentz eventually asked the workers to pray aloud with her, and at that time the priest appeared to pray with them and reassure them.
