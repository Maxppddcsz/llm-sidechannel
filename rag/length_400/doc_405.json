NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Human Resources department in the town council at first discovered that the two men had not been to work for a single day in 2015 or so far in 2016 when they were going through their records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on further inspection they discovered that the period stretched much further back than they could have imagined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Two representatives of the General Confederation of Labour union (the CGT) could have gone years without coming to work; according to a written statement by the men themselves this situation could date back 15 years,\" the town hall of Jerez de la Frontera wrote in a statement, published on its website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CGT union, to which both men belong, has defended its unionists, arguing that they were simply taking off their \"accumulated days\" and those of other employees, which can be shared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It argued that their absence was part of a “tacit agreement” with the various town councils over the 15 year period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After being questioned by Human Resources, one of the men returned to work, while the other produced a written statement explaining that he had accumulated the union hours of his colleagues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The town hall, however, said this was \"insufficient to free him from work for the rest of the year, which was his intention\".
