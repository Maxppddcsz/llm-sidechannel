(Photo: John Mone, AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is it time for Congress to get involved in regulating the size of airline seats? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s what one member of the House of Representatives is proposing. Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen – who sits on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Subcommittee on Aviation – plans to introduce legislation that would institute minimum seat sizes for passenger airlines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BOOKMARK: Go directly to the Today in the Sky homepage NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen plans to offer his “Seat Egress in Air Travel Act” – or SEAT Act – as an amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization bill, which the committee is scheduled to vote on this Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen’s move comes as some airlines have introduced new slimmer seat designs during the past decade that have allowed them to squeeze more seats onto planes. The slimmer seats are also lighter, helping carriers save fuel. And beyond the so-called \"slimline' seats, certain carriers -- led in particular by a new breed of ultra low-cost carriers -- have also become more aggressive in reducing leg room as part of their efforts to increase capacity on their aircraft. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CLOSE It's not your imagination. There really is a tighter squeeze on many planes these days. That's because the major carriers are using thinner seats to pack in more passengers. (Oct. 15) AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for Cohen’s SEAT Act, it likely faces long odds about ultimately being passed into law. But Cohen intends to push ahead with the effort. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Shrinking seats raise safety and health concerns, and it’s time for the FAA to take action,” Cohen says in a statement. “The FAA requires that planes be capable of rapid evacuation in case of emergency, yet they haven’t conducted emergency evacuation tests on all of today’s smaller seats.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen also plays to health concerns in advocating for his SEAT Act, adding in his statement that “doctors have also warned that deep vein thrombosis can afflict passengers who can’t move their legs during longer flights. Consumers are tired of being squeezed both physically and fiscally by airlines.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TWITTER: You can follow me at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky NEWLINE_CHAR",
