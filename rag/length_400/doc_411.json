    "0": "Table Legend Coloration The color of the table entries gives a rough interpretation of the severity of the threat. Small objects are not likely to cause significant damage in the event of an impact, although impact damage does depend heavily upon the specific (and usually unknown) physical properties of the object in question. Small Objects Torino Scale Colors Estimated diameter 50 meters or less. 0 1 2,3,4 5,6,7 8,9,10 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Object Designation Temporary designation or permanent number for this object. Assigned by the Minor Planet Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Year Range Time span over which impacts have been detected. Typically, searches are conducted 100 years into the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Potential Impacts The number of dynamically distinct potential impacts that have been detected by Sentry. There can be several qualitatively unique pathways to impact in a given year, e.g., some with an extra revolutions around the sun, others deflected to impact by an earlier planetary encounter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Impact Prob. (cum.) The sum of the impact probabilities from all detected potential impacts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR V infinity The velocity of the asteroid relative to the Earth, assuming a massless Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR H Absolute Magnitude is an intrinsic measure of brightness. It is the apparent magnitude of the object when it is 1 AU from both the sun and the observer, and at full phase for the observer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Est. Diam. The estimated diameter of the asteroid. This is an estimate based on the absolute magnitude, usually assuming a uniform spherical body with visual albedo p V = 0.154 (in accordance with the Palermo Scale) but sometimes using actual measured values if these are available. Since the albedo is rarely known for objects on this page, the diameter estimate should be considered only approximate, but in most cases will be accurate to within a factor of two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Palermo Scale (cum.) & (max.) The cumulative and maximum hazard ratings according to the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Torino Scale (max.) The maximum detected hazard rating using the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. According to this ten-point scale, a rating of zero indicates the event has \"no likely consequences.\" A Torino Scale rating of 1 indicates an event that \"merits careful monitoring.\" Even higher ratings indicate that progressively more concern is warranted.
