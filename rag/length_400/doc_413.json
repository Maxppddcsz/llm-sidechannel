Movie Review: Killers, PG, 102 min by Genevieve Loh When your movie review is given a worldwide embargo date of the film's US opening, your antennae goes up immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a tactic studios normally employ when there's a guaranteed niche audience (horror movies or films based on video games) that will show up regardless of reviews. Or when the movie sucks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Killers - a mainstream romantic comedy with two high-profile eye-candy stars - is clearly not the former, I entered the cinema with the lowest of expectations. And, surprisingly, came out unscathed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Katherine Heigl is un-spontaneous, sweet Jen who, while vacationing with her parents (a hilarious Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara) in Nice, meets the hot-bodied Spencer (pretty boy Ashton Kutcher), and instantly falls in love. Life for the next three years is newlywed suburban bliss - until things take a dramatic turn when it is revealed Spencer is actually a super spy and professional assassin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both script and premise reek of a Mr And Mrs Smith meets True Lies knock-off, but director Robert Luketic (of the universally panned The Ugly Truth) delivers a film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Sure, the film, with its too-long-drawn first act, is clearly not in a hurry to tell a story, mostly due to the simple fact there is none. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, strangely, you're somewhat entertained, thanks to just-enough sporadic laugh-out-loud scenes juxtaposed with high gun action. Couple that with Heigl and Kutcher's anti-chemistry (she's his Beavis to his Butthead), and you'll surprise yourself by being not entirely bored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe it's Kutcher's ripped abs (further exploited with requisite topless scenes) and pretty face. Or maybe Heigl didn't annoy me as much as she did in The Ugly Truth. Or maybe, just maybe, enjoying Killers depends entirely on your mood and expectations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the film's gaping holes and obvious shortcomings, it still manages to make you snicker with the actors' combined goofiness and the film's overall idiosyncrasies.
