NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least one yellow-bellied sea snake, which lives its entire life in the ocean, was recently spotted on a beach in the Oxnard area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reptile typically lives in warmer tropical waters, and its appearance is probably a harbinger of El Niño, the cyclical weather phenomenon connected to warmer sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, according to Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The snake sighting was highlighted by the nonprofit environmental advocacy group in a blog post on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Yellow-bellied Sea Snake has some of the most poisonous venom in the world, and is a descendant from Asian cobras and Australian tiger snakes,\" stated the post by Heal the Bay’s senior coastal policy manager, Dana Murray. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s the first time since the early 1980s that the black-and-yellow snake has been seen in California, according to Heal the Bay. The last yellow-bellied sea snake sighted was also during an El Niño phase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two sightings were reported in Oxnard, but it wasn’t clear if they were of the same snake, Murray said in an email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “No need to panic,” the organization said on its Facebook page, calling the snake \"exotic\" and \"incredibly venomous.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anna Iker said she spotted a snake on Silver Strand Beach near Oxnard on Thursday. It was washed back out to sea, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert Forbes also spotted a yellow-bellied sea snake, possibly the same one, on the same beach. He found it about 9 a.m. Friday, he said, and called the state wildlife department. The snake had died by the time officials arrived hours later, Forbes said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The snake was being taken to the Museum of Natural History of Los Angeles, Forbes said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yellow-bellied sea snakes are extremely venomous and members of the public are advised not to touch them.
