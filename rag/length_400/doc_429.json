    "0": "Mitt Romney defended his foreign investments in an interview aired Sunday, noting that his personal finances have followed all U.S. laws and he got no special tax savings from a Swiss bank account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Well, first of all, there was no reduction, not one dollar reduction in taxes by virtue of having an account in Switzerland or a Cayman Islands investment,” the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said in a ‘\"Fox News Sunday\" interview. “The dollars of taxes remained exactly the same. There was no tax savings at all.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Romney added that his blind trustee made decisions “entirely consistent with U.S. law and all the taxes paid were those legally owed and there was no tax savings by virtue of these entities.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama’s campaign and Democrats have used Romney’s Swiss bank account and his other foreign financial dealings to portray the Republican as an out-of-touch businessman.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I understand that’s what the Democrats and what the Obama people will do,” he said, adding that blind trusts often turn to foreign currencies. \"That tends to be something investors do. But they’re trying to make it seem like it’s some unsavory action. And frankly all the taxes are paid exactly as owed and there was no tax savings by virtue of having that vehicle.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read more about: Barack Obama, Mitt",
