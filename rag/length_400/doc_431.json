NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In documents filed this week as part of a legal challenge to the FCC’s net neutrality repeal, Santa Clara County Fire Marshal Anthony Bowden explains how Verizon slowed device speeds during the crisis, hindering firefighters’ response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The throttling hindered firefighters’ response NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the documents, flagged by Ars Technica, Bowden writes that the fire department had purchased an unlimited data plan from Verizon for a support unit’s connection, but the company started throttling speeds “to 1/200, or less” after the unit hit 25GB of use.
