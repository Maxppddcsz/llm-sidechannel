Mental illness, so central to the Newtown killings, also played a role in more than half of the other 71. Stray bullets from neighborhood gun battles or drive-by shootings killed 22 children. Drugs, typically methamphetamine, were a factor in six others. Perhaps most striking was how many of the children knew their killers. Seventeen were shot by their mothers, according to police; another 17 by their fathers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Newtown, every one of these killings has provoked a special kind of despair among the survivors — parents, relatives, friends, neighbors, police officers, teachers, pastors. And as in Newtown, all of these people have continued to mourn, regret, reflect on and agonize over the deaths as their first anniversaries have come and gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What I experienced, I’ll never move on from it,” said one of the parents, Carlton Stringer Sr., who discovered the body of his 6-month-old son on the morning of Jan. 15, allegedly shot by a friend of one of the other victims. “I was crying, screaming and scared,” he said. “The police told me to go to counseling. But that won’t help. It is always going to play in my head. It is something I got to live with for the rest of my life.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In all, four children were deliberately shot to death in January. In February came another six. One was Chaniya Wynn of Cleveland. The 1-year-old girl and her mother were killed in an abandoned garage by the mother’s ex-boyfriend, who then killed himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chaniya’s aunt, Cherie Jackson, remembers arriving at the garage just as the police and coroner were leaving. She came with 10 cans of spray paint. “I wanted it to look like they were loved,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “RIP my baby sister. RIP my baby niece,” she spray-painted on the garage. “I love you so much.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She stepped back. Soon others were grabbing spray-paint cans. First they covered the outside walls of the garage and then the inside. The windowless building stood for a year before the local neighborhood association flattened it. “Too many bad memories,” Jackson says of the building. “Now it is just a patch of dirt.” baby always by pastors. coroner building. bad were coroner She were killers. one other were killings, baby move Cleveland. despair 22",
