(WKRN) – New details were released Wednesday in the more than month-long investigation into the disappearance of 15-year-old Maury County girl Elizabeth Thomas and her former teacher Tad Cummins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR District Attorney Brent Cooper told News 2 Cummins left a note for his wife, Jill, on the morning of March 13, the day they vanished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He told her he had a job interview at I think 10 o’clock that morning. When she came home, she found this note. It was basically, ”I’m going somewhere and I’ll be back.'” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cooper said the note was a diversion to buy Cummins time and mislead the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “His goal was to disappear with Elizabeth, so if your goal is to disappear then you don’t leave somebody a note telling them where you are going,” the DA told News 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said Cummins is on medication to control his blood pressure and should be in need of a refill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We knew he was probably due for a refill and there was a good chance he would refill that or try to. If they are in Mexico, he could probably buy them without a prescription.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cooper asks that pharmacy employees be on the lookout for Cummins and Thomas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “All pharmacist, pharmacy employees, walk-in clinics anyone that’s either working those locations or anyone that just happens to be in those locations just be alert and if you see what you think is them let us know,” he explained.
