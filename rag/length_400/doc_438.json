You could score the chance to hit up a Taylor Swift show in the near future simply by doing what you do best: being sticklers to the extreme about words. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's right, The Princeton Review is offering two grammatically stellar fans Swift seats -- all as part of an apology to the \"Blank Space\" singer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What now? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For those not in the know, the dust was kicked up this week when a Taylor Swift fan noticed that The Princeton Review had used one of the singer's lyrics in an SAT prep book as an example of poor grammar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sure, that was insulting enough to the Swiftie, but what's worse is that the lyric -- from the song \"Fifteen\" -- was incorrect. Taylor even entered the fray, posting, â€œYou had one job, test people. One job\" to Tumblr, along with the offending image of the test book. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"Test People,\" for their part, were appropriately cowed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I want to make sure that folks know that we're big Taylor Swift fans and that we apologize for the misrepresentation in the lyric,\" The Princeton Review's SVP-publisher Rob Franek told MTV News on Tuesday (March 24), noting that the Review reached out to Swift on Twitter and asked her to pick two fans to score tickets to her next show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Franek wasn't entirely apologetic about using the lyric in the first place as a lesson in poor grammar. \"I appreciate her response, but the question on the grammar still holds true,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we look at the whole sentence, it starts off with 'somebody,' and 'somebody,' as you know, is a singular pronoun and if it's singular, the rest of the sentence has to be singular,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, in order to fix the Tay's grammar, you'd have to take, \"Somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them\" and change it to either: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Somebody tells you he/she loves you, you're gonna believe him/her.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Or: \"Some people tell you they love you, you're gonna believe them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think we all learned a valuable lesson today. Now, Taylor, about those tickets... Grammar you're but",
