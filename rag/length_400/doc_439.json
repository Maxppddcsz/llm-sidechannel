NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apple has built an \"auto work area\" and \"repair garage\" in the town of Sunnyvale, where one neighbor complained of \"motor noises\" late at night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Construction at Apple's Sunnyvale campus, as seen last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More coverage: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A resident who lives near Apple's automotive campus in Sunnyvale issued a complaint to city officials last year over concern about noise coming from the property.

Last year, representatives for the property received permits to build a 10-foot-tall security fence around the buildings Apple occupies, citing the need for both \"physical security\" and \"visual privacy.\" The permits were required because the fence exceeds local height restrictions.Numerous additional permits for construction inside the buildings specifically say the improvements were done \"for Apple,\" leaving little question as to who requested the security",
