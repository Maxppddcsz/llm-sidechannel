NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For much of the video, you can only hear the owners of Green Acres talk about the deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Can you imagine being responsible for all these deaths? It is horrifying, we have ran it over in our minds like 1000 times. There is nothing we could have done to prevent this. We operated the same way we operated the thousands of times we have done this,\" said the voice of Meliesa Hughes.Inside the home the people claiming dogs asked many questions including some about the relatives who were supposed to be watching over the dogs while the owners of the boarding house were out of town.\"They didn't know what to do, so we told them to sit tight till we got here, you know what, how do you prepare yourself for something like this,\" said Hughes\"We got the sheriff involved, we cooperated fully, if you guys know anything about Joe Arpaio hs is an animal proponent, and they investigated us throughly and didn't press charges, it was an accident,\" she said.Actually, it was the dog owners who first called MCSO. The owners were also asked why they told some people their pets had run away.\"There is nothing in life that could have prepared us for this, so my husband panicked and made a bad decision, we did have one that ran off, that is true,\" said Hughes.\"We just want to get the dog and leave, are you kidding me?, What is wrong with people? What is wrong with you? Like what is wrong with you? Did you not see what happened here today,\" she said.At the point the video ended you heard her mention that one of the dogs escaped. That dog is believed to be a Belgian malinois named Valor.Volunteers have been searching for Valor over the past few days. Sheriff Joe Arpaio said that MCSO sent a helicopter up to help in the search. There are also three mounted posse members and two deputies searching near the boarding facility.\"Some people may criticize me for going to these lengths to find this dog. But after what this community has been through with this awful situation at the boarding facility, if we can find one canine survivor, we'll all feel a lot better,\"",
