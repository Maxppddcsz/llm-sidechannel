NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR GOSHEN - The Poughkeepsie woman accused of killing her fiance on the Hudson River was at a pretrial hearing Monday to determine whether statements she made to police could be used by prosecutors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawyers for both sides dispute the validity of a confession police obtained while interviewing Angelika Graswald.
