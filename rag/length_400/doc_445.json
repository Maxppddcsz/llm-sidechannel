NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eight of the guests who will sit in the House chamber as guests of the White House during Tuesday’s prime-time speech wrote letters that made their way to Mr. Obama’s desk, making them living, breathing examples of the policies he will discuss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is Rebekah Erler, a 36-year-old working mother who wrote to the president last March about the financial challenges she was facing while raising her young family. Ms. Erler, who introduced the president when he visited her hometown, Minneapolis, last June, has a story tailor-made for Mr. Obama’s new economic initiatives, including proposals to make community college free and to provide larger tax credits for child care and education and a new credit for families with two working spouses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ana Zamora of Dallas, another letter-writer, is a so-called Dreamer – brought to the United States illegally as a child by her parents – allowed to stay in the country and work through Mr. Obama’s 2012 executive action. Ms. Zamora’s parents, who have other children born in the United States, will be eligible for the president’s more recent unilateral move in November to extend such benefits to the parents of American citizens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all of the letter-writing guests wrote directly to the president. Malik Bryant, 13, meant his letter for Santa Claus, whom he asked to bring him “safety” as his holiday gift. But a nonprofit organization redirected the letter to the White House, where the president saw and responded to it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president receives 10 letters each day in his briefing materials, hand-selected by his staff from the tens of thousands that come to the White House daily on paper and by email and fax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The eight letter-writers are among 22 guests the White House has announced will sit with Michelle Obama in her box during the speech. Others include Alan P. Gross, the American released last month after five years of captivity in Cuba, and Scott Kelly, an astronaut scheduled to leave soon for a year aboard the International Space Station.
