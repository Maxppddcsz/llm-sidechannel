NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carlson challenged Duca for tweeting the following about Ivanka Trump shortly after she was confronted loudly on an airplane: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ivanka Trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world. Don't let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good. — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 23, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Duca told Carlson she thinks Ivanka Trump shouldn’t be confronted like that in public, especially with her kids present, but also said the incoming First Daughter is not immune from criticism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carlson repeatedly confronted Duca for saying that Trump has a “sinister complicity” in the agenda pushed by her father. Duca completely stood by that comment and emphasized that there’s a difference between harassment of Trump and legitimate criticism of her for backing up the “most anti-woman candidate in decades.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As they kept going back and forth, Duca told off Carlson for interrupting her saying: “You’re actually being a partisan hack that’s just attacking me ad nauseam and not allowing me to speak.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carlson moved on to her recent viral column about Trump “gaslighting” America, and when he said “Teen Vogue, which I guess you write for,” Duca immediately mocked his response by pointing out that, of course, he knew she wrote the magazine article from which he was quoting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They then continued to battle over Duca’s contention that Trump is engaging in psychological warfare, and at one point Carlson brought up the fact that she writes about topics like Ariana Grande and thigh-high boots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carlson concluded the interview by saying, “You should stick to the thigh-high boots. You’re better at that.” Duca started to fire back but Carlson ended the segment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She did, however, tweet this out afterwards: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR .@TuckerCarlson is an enemy of rational discourse. In this fraught moment, his bully tactics are profoundly damaging, and achieve nothing. — Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 24, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch the video above, via Fox News.
