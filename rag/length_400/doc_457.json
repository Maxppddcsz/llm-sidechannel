Wash. pot grower has trouble giving away $14,000 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Share this story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR print NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR email NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROSSER, Wash. - An Eastern Washington marijuana grower who made $600,000 in the first recreational pot auction in Washington planned to donate some of the proceeds, but he's having trouble giving money away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fireweed Farms owner Randy Williams of Prosser said after last month's auction of 300 pounds of marijuana to state-licensed processors and retailers that he would donate $14,000 to local schools. The money is from the sale of non-intoxicating pot that is sometimes given to kids with a seizure disorder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the Prosser School District said no thanks, explaining it would not be in the interest of students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, the Prosser branch of the Boys and Girls Club also is just saying no to drug money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"After careful review, we decided to decline the donation in order to not distract the community from our mission and the opportunities we promote to our youth,\" said local Boys and Girl's Club Executive Director Brian Ace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Prosser residents said they thought the school district and the club were unwise to turn down the money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's good for the children education-wise. Boys and Girls Club, by all means, do what you gotta do,\" said Prosser resident Shelly Best. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vietnam veteran Walt Catilleja said, \"I thought it was kind of foolish. They need the money. They need the money in a lot of ways.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They take money from the lottery, they take money from the wineries, they take money from breweries, distilleries, and some of the marijuana tax that's going to the state is coming back to them. They should have taken the money,\" said another man, who identified himself only as Rick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams said he gave $1,000 to the local VFW Post and the rest to local families in need. He says it's ultimately the school district's loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Boys and Girls Club says it won't rule out gifts like this in the future, but need to take a look at their standards.
