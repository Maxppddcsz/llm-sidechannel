NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Air Force General Paul Selva speaks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, U.S., October 28, 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this month North Korea said it had conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and that it had mastered the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on the missile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But General Paul Selva, speaking before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the July 4th test stopped short of showing North Korea had “the capacity to strike the United States with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pyongyang’s state media said the test successfully verified the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead, which experts say may be able to reach the U.S. state of Alaska. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What the experts tell me is that the North Koreans have yet to demonstrate the capacity to do the guidance and control that would be required,” said Selva, the second highest-ranking U.S. military official. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR South Korea’s intelligence agency also does not believe North Korea has secured re-entry capabilities for its ICBM program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR South Korea on Monday proposed military talks with North Korea, the first formal overture to Pyongyang by the government of President Moon Jae-in, to discuss ways to avoid hostile acts near the heavily militarized border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty and the past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism and rhetoric that have always stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tensions have risen sharply after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked about preemptive military operations against North Korea, Selva said he believed that “we have to entertain that potential option.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We need to think seriously about what the consequences of that action might be,” Selva said. re-entry accuracy",
