NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The post alleged that the executive, who is married to a woman, had attempted to solicit the services of a male escort. It immediately drew widespread condemnation from journalists and other public figures who described it as \"reprehensible\" and accused Gawker's journalists of being \"hypocrites and thugs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Denton said Friday that he regretted publishing the article: \"We are proud of running stories that others shy away from, often to preserve relationships or access. But the line has moved. And Gawker has an influence and audience that demands greater editorial restraint,\" he wrote.

That has been the longstanding position of Gawker journalists, some of the most uncompromising and uncompromised on the internet,\" he wrote. \"I cannot blame our editors and writers for pursuing that original mission.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Denton said \"the media environment has changed, our readers have changed, and I have changed.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Not only is criticism of yesterday’s piece from readers intense, but much of what they’ve said has resonated. Some of our own writers, proud to work at one of the only independent media companies, are equally appalled,\" he wrote. \"I believe this public mood reflects a growing recognition that we all have secrets, and they are not all equally worthy of exposure.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This action will not turn back the clock,\" he continued. \"[The executive's] embarrassment will not be eased. But this decision will establish a clear standard for future stories. It is not enough for them simply to be true. They have to reveal something meaningful. They have to be true and interesting.\" \"reprehensible\" from, with journalists, the",
