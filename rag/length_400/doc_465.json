Proving that he's still proud of the way he looks, Diesel took to Instagram to respond to the criticism â€“ by flaunting his trim physique, of course.To start, the Fast and Furious actor, 48, shared a photo of himself looking muscular in a black T-shirt and jeans.\"It is amazing the response from the journalists who I have been talking to for the last two days in New York. Today one wanted to see the dad bod. Haha,\" he wrote in his first post over the weekend after spending the day promoting his new film The Last Witch Hunter. \"I am wondering if I should show the picture... Body-shaming is always wrong! What do you think?\"And of course, fans jumped at the opportunity to see if Diesel really did have a \"dad bod,\" or if it was simply just an off-day.In the second photo, he lifted his shirt to reveal his rock-hard abs, silencing the haters once and for all.\"The pic from yesterday... For those who wanted the show... For all the angels that love dad bod regardless...\" Diesel, captioned the photo.It's safe to say, he's still got it.
