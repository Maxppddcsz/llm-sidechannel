NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amid a national women's movement, some are looking at this case very closely and posing a question 'would there have been a different outcome if it were a man?' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moments after Hargrave's arrest the issue was raised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have never seen a man removed from this room,\" Laura LeBouef, a Vermilion Parish school board member, said after the arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along with LeBouef, some have implied that Hargrave may have been targeted because she's a woman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video has caused concerns, not just locally. Daytime show, The Talk, weighed in on the viral video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If that had been a male would he have been handcuffed and ordered out? She wasn't being violent,\" Sharon Osbourne said. \"She wasn't lashing out at anybody and they did that because she's a woman.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now some online are pointing to a recent video of a Vermilion Parish School Board meeting.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Noticeably, no marshal appeared to intervene. However, board president Tony Fontana stands by the arrest of Hargrave. He says gender isn't the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The board member on the other side forgot that we banned the husband of one of the board members from coming back on board property because of acting out in an incident,\" Fontana stated about Lebouef's comment. \"We couldn't ban the board member so we banned the husband who was involved in it. So all this stuff about this is a woman's issue is B-S'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the topic of gender, Fontana is now facing even more criticism over an interview concerning Hargrave's arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everybody wants to side on the poor little woman who got thrown out,\" Fontana told WAFB during a phone interview. \"Well, she made a choice. She could have walked out and nothing would have happened.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President of the Louisiana Association of Educators, Debbie Meaux, disagrees with Fontana. \"This didn't have to happen to this 'little woman' as he calls her, but her name is Deyshia Hargrave.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Click here to read the full story and more on",
