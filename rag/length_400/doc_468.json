They told us to stretch, and I just saw these people going: “Boo! Bernie!” Whatever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When you’re a comic, and you do material that you mean in one way, and people take it in another — like years ago, I would do a lot of racial stuff, and I meant it in a very bleeding-heart liberal way, ultimately. By being the idiot.There were people who would take that literally, and we would call those mouth-full-of-blood laughs. They’re the laughs you don’t want.

It’s what they want so badly. I just felt like, let the comedian defuse it and just address the elephant in the room. But they were like, no. And they are right. They’re right. But I get so indignant. At least I’m aware, and awareness brings change, so maybe I’ll be less obnoxious. stuff, is all. people fundamentalists comic, of NEWLINE_CHAR we They’re badly. the and It allow? you’re another you being",
