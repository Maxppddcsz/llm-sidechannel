NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The grandfather of the future US president left the city at the age of 16, first arriving in New York in 1885 and later moving further west during the Gold Rush era. There, he made his money running taverns and a brothel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He returned to Kallstadt as a wealthy man in 1901 and met his future wife Elisabeth Christ. The two married and moved to New York in 1902, but returned to Kallstadt two years later, with Elisabeth complaining of extreme homesickness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kallstadt's current population is around 1,200 inhabitants NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Monday's report, the authorities soon discovered that Friedrich Trump had never performed the mandatory military service before leaving Germany. Another problem, according to local historian Roland Paul, was that Trump never officially unregistered from his hometown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The German-born businessman was banned from \"reclaiming his citizenship in 1905,\" Paul said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Letter to the prince NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump was labeled a draft-dodger and officials ordered him to leave the Kingdom of Bavaria, which at the time included Kallstadt. The town is currently part of the Rhineland-Palatinate state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The American citizen and pensioner Friedrich Trump, currently residing in Kallstadt, is hereby informed that he is to depart the state of Bavaria, or face deportation,\" authorities said in a document dated in February 1905. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historian Roland Paul also found a letter that Friedrich Trump sent to the Bavarian prince regent Luitpold a few months later, imploring the \"well-loved, noble, wise and just\" prince to heed his \"most modest plea\" and allow him to stay in Germany. The court denied the request. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move forced the Trumps to leave Germany for good in July 1905, and return to New York. Elisabeth Trump was pregnant at the time. Three months after their return to the US, she had Fred Trump, who grew up to become a real-estate magnate and the father of the current President-elect Donald Trump.
