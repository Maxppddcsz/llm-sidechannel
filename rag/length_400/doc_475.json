NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sandpipers go the extra 8,000 miles to have as much sex as possible Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is only the second recorded example of sexual relations between two distantly related species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snow monkeys and sika deer generally have a symbiotic relationship, with the deer eating fruits dropped from the trees by the monkeys and the monkeys grooming the deer and occasionally riding on their backs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest paper, published in the journal Primates, describes how a low-ranking male monkey was observed repeatedly performing sexual mounts on at least two different female deer. One doe was seen to bolt and run off, but another female did not appear to object, and licked her side after the monkey ejaculated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This individual showed clearly sexual behaviour towards several female deer, some of which tried to escape whilst others accepted the mount,” the paper reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marie Pelé, the lead author based at the University of Strasbourg in France, said: “No ambiguity is possible, it is clearly sexual behaviour.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only previous reported case of sexual interactions between two distantly related species, was that of an Antarctic fur seal observed sexually harassing king penguins – and in one instance, eating a bird after having sex with it.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scientists said that “mate deprivation” was the most likely explanation for the unusual behaviour, after also considering the possibility that the male was learning to copulate or had failed to recognise that the deer was a member of another species.
