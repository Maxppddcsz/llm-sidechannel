NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos will join forces on an ambitious mission called the Deep Space Gateway (DSG), an American-led plan to put a human-accessible space station in cislunar, or near-Moon, orbit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, representatives of NASA and Roscosmos at the 68th International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia, signed an agreement to work together on the orbital Moon base. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Designed to dock with NASA's next-generation Orion spacecraft, the DSG would support a crew of four astronauts, making it an invaluable pit stop for human and robotic exploration of the lunar surface. The gateway would also be a staging point for deep space missions to Mars, Venus, or other distant locations. The station's modules are currently scheduled to be built in the 2020s.
