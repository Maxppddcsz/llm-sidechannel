NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 60% of giant herbivores - plant-eaters - including rhinos, elephants and gorillas, are at risk of extinction, according to research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis of 74 herbivore species, published in Science Advances, blamed poaching and habitat loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A previous study of large carnivores showed similar declines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prof William Ripple, of Oregon State University, led the research looking at herbivores weighing over 100kg, from the reindeer up to the African elephant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is the first time anyone has analysed all of these species as a whole,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The process of declining animals is causing an empty landscape in the forest, savannah, grasslands and desert.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Halszka Hrabar Image caption The threatened mountain zebra NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prof David Macdonald, of Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, was among the team of 15 international scientists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The big carnivores, like the charismatic big cats or wolves, face horrendous problems from direct persecution, over-hunting and habitat loss, but our new study adds another nail to their coffin - the empty larder,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's no use having habitat if there's nothing left to eat in it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the research, the decline is being driven by a number of factors including habitat loss, hunting for meat or body parts, and competition for food and resources with livestock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With rhinoceros horn worth more than gold, diamonds or cocaine on illegal markets, rhinos could be extinct in the wild within 20 years in Africa, said the researchers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The consequences of large wild herbivore decline include: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Loss of habitat: for example, elephants maintain forest clearings by trampling vegetation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Effects on the food chain: large predators such as lions, leopards, and hyena rely on large herbivores for food NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seed dispersal: large herbivores eat seeds which are carried over long distances NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Impact on humans: an estimated one billion people rely on wild meat for subsistence while the loss of iconic herbivores will have a negative impact on tourism NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The biggest losses are in South East Asia, India and Africa.
