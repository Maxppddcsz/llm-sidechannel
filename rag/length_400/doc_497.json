All interns! Anthony wants to say hello.\" We crowded into Weiner's private office in his new 5th Avenue campaign headquarters, where he stayed reclined in a cheap, black leather chair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I always say that on every campaign, there are one or two volunteers who really make a difference,\" he began. (There were roughly twenty of us in the room.) \"So I just want to let you know that no task is too small, and the work you're doing is important and it is appreciated.\" He continued to speak for a few minutes, reiterating this point over and over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Okay!\" Weiner said loudly, though not enthusiastically. \"I'm going to go around the room now and ask you your name and a fact about yourself, and then I'm going to go back around and repeat your name to you.\" A member of the campaign staff looked on, nervously. \"I'm great at this,\" Weiner said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I stood second in line, next to \"Stephanie, I speak three languages. I love romance languages.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weiner nodded at me to introduce myself, \"Hi, I'm Olivia\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You were at the Gay Pride event with us in Brooklyn, right?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yeah -\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Thanks for helping out, really appreciate it. Next?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Okay!\" Weiner had heard from us all. \"Now I'm going to repeat your names back to you. I'm really good at this,\" he confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He paused and squinted his eyes at Stephanie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Monica?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Stephanie.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We all laughed nervously. Monica is an interesting intern name to pick out of the air. (Weiner's wife, we should remember, works for Hillary Clinton.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh, that's right. Okay, next.\" He paused again and squinted his eyes at me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Monica!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More nervous laughter. \"Olivia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After getting the following three interns' names wrong, he gave up and released us back into the main office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A little while later, I walked down the hallway and bumped into Weiner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Monica?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Still Olivia!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Update: Anthony Weiner's communications director responds -- calls Olivia a \"cunt\". Really.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New to NSFWCORP? Subscribe for",
