The previous low point was 10%, registered twice in 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These results are from a Gallup poll conducted Nov. 7-10. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congress approval fell to 11% in October, during the U.S. government shutdown. Although the shutdown is now history, Americans' views of Congress have not recovered, but instead have edged lower. By contrast, Americans' confidence in the economy has begun to improve in the last several weeks. The continuing depression in Americans' views of Congress has occurred even though the troubles with the rollout of President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act are now dominating U.S. political news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Public displeasure with Congress is equally rampant across political groups, with Republicans (9%), independents (8%), and Democrats (10%) giving the institution similarly low approval ratings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty percent of Democrats approved of Congress in September, but their approval plummeted to 5% in October during the shutdown. This month, Democrats' approval improved slightly, but is still well below levels measured earlier this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yearly Congressional Approval on Track to Be Lowest Ever NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congressional approval for the first 11 months of 2013 is 14%, on track to be the lowest yearly average in Gallup history, one percentage point below last year's 15% average. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Americans have rarely been highly positive about Congress, which has an average approval rating of 33% since 1974. Congressional approval on an annual basis was highest in 2001 at 56%, reflecting the rally effect after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But since the 2008 financial crisis, approval has been particularly low, with the exception of the months after Obama's first inauguration in 2009. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Implications NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government shutdown in October clearly didn't help Congress' image, and it appears that the impact of that incident may linger, given the record-low approval this month. This no doubt reflects the rancorous partisanship and bickering that characterized the shutdown -- the top reasons given by those who disapprove of Congress. Having a divided Congress -- with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats controlling the Senate -- means there are complaints among partisans on both sides, reflected in similarly low congressional approval ratings among Republicans",
