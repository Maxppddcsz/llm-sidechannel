Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. You belong here, and we need you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pichai’s remarks were especially noteworthy because of their juxtaposition with the controversy happening at Google right now, after a software engineer posted a diversity-related memo that went viral both within the company and in public sphere. The author of the memo, which questioned Google’s diversity training and women’s aptitude for coding, has since been fired from the company, and has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The public appearance by Pichai also came just after Google canceled a company-wide town hall meeting, which had been scheduled to address some of the fallout from the memo. The meeting was canceled, according to a report in Recode, after employees who had sent preliminary questions started getting harassed online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It's really important that more women and girls have the opportunity to participate in technology, to learn how to code, create, and innovate,” Pichai said.

And Google has also been sued for its salary records by the US Department of Labor, which has alleged that Google doesn’t pay female employees fairly.
