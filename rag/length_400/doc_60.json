NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team of researchers from Japan's Shizuoka University and other institutions will conduct the first test in space this month as part of a project to build a space elevator, Japan's The Mainichi reported last week. The space elevator essentially ferries people and cargo shipments in an elevator car travelling on a cable connecting Earth to a space station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This test is the first exploring the movement of a container on a cable in space. Two ultra-small cubic satellites measuring 10 centimeters on each side connected by a steel cable about 10 metres long will be carried from Kagoshima's Tanegashima Space Center to the International Space Station on Sept. 11. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From there, the connected satellites will be launched and a motorised container acting as an elevator car will travel along the cable and have its journey recorded via a camera attached to the satellites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The project's technical advisor, Japan's construction giant Obayashi Corporation, is also working on a similar project, though it previously said it expects to deliver a space elevator by 2050. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mainichi identified a number of obstacles researchers face. These include the development of special cables that are resistant to high-energy cosmic rays (Obayashi said carbon nanotubes are a strong candidate as the cables' material), the transmission of electricity from Earth to space and keeping cosmic elevators safe from collisions with space debris and meteorites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Space elevators are expected to cut the costs -- and risks -- of space travel massively if they can be realized. While cargo would typically cost about $22,000 per kilogram via shuttle, Obayashi's elevator will cut that to about $200. Researchers also expect these elevators to travel up to 200 kilometers per hour and arrive at the ISS eight days after launch, said the publication.
