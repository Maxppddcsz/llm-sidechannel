NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unusual find is called a \"disrupted binary pulsar\"; these pulsars can be created when a massive star collapses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discoverers, from the US and Germany found the object with the help of the Einstein@Home project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It asks users to donate time on their computers, allowing them to be used for searching through scientific data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This type of project is known as \"distributed computing\". Einstein@Home harnesses the power of home machines in order to process large amounts of data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Credited with the discovery are Chris and Helen Colvin, both information technology professionals from Iowa, US, and systems analyst Daniel Gebhardt from Mainz in Germany. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their computers, along with 500,000 others from around the world, are being used to analyse data for Einstein@Home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Users download a screensaver which, among other things, shows the area of sky being processed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newly discovered radio pulsar, given the designation PSR J2007+2722, is a fast-spinning neutron star which can be formed in certain types of supernovae, or stellar explosions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This lone pulsar rotates 41 times per second and has an unusually low magnetic field. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jim Cordes, professor of astronomy at Cornell University in Ithaca, US, said the object once had a companion star from which it acquired mass. But this companion has since exploded; this has kicked the surviving object free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We think there should be more of these disrupted binary pulsars, but there haven't been that many found,\" said Professor Cordes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image caption The pulsar was discovered in data collected by the Arecibo Observatory NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No matter what else we find out about it, this pulsar is bound to be extremely interesting for understanding the basic physics of neutron stars and how they form.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the discovery demonstrated the power of such distributed computing networks to collect and sort through vast amounts of data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Einstein@Home was originally organised to find gravitational waves - ripples in space-time. The latest find was made by searching through radio astronomy data collected the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, US. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About",
