NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She became one of 46 people who took their lives at the landmark span last year, according to figures released Monday by a group advocating for more suicide barriers on the bridge. The group said the deaths were the most since the bridge opened in 1937. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Larkspur high schooler, known as a caring overachiever, had sent out a questionnaire for a story she was working on for the school newspaper 30 minutes before her suicide, said her father, Nicolas Aparicio. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Gabri struggled with depression, he believes the questionnaire was proof that the teen wanted to live - and could have been saved. But she acted on an impulse, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If it wasn't for the easy access at the bridge, I still believe my daughter would be alive today,\" Aparicio said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aparicio joined dozens of other parents and family members of people who have jumped from the bridge for a news conference Monday morning outside San Francisco City Hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 1,600 people have committed suicide by jumping off the bridge since its inception. Gabri was one of 10 in August 2013, said Ken Holmes, a retired Marin County coroner and board member for the advocacy group, the Bridge Rail Foundation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holmes and the family members called for the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission to put in the safety net they approved in 2008 but haven't installed due to funding. The bridge district needs $45 million to build the net. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We believe that if you ask the individual to step away from their means of suicide, then you remove that temptation and you lower their risk of following through in the moment as well as in the future,\" said Meghan Freebeck, development director for San Francisco Suicide Prevention, a telephone crisis center. \"The cost of a safety net is nothing compared to the cost of a person's life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aparicio said, \"It is too late for Gabri. But this net would save lives, and it will save the eternal grief that families like us will have to live through.\" easy the Nicolas deaths and the believes",
