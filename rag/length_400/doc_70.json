NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Police officers understandably [are] upset,” an anchor says haltingly, after the audio feed was apparently cut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A recording from an LAPD police scanner pulled from an unofficial Internet stream also includes numerous references to “burners,” which is police slang for tear gas canisters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Alright, we’re gonna go ahead with the plan with the burners,” one officer says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Copy,” replies another.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The burners are deployed, and we have a fire,” another voice says shortly afterwards. The dispatcher repeats that statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Listen: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police officials late in the day said a burned body had been found in the cabin, but they did not confirm whether it was Dorner. It remains unclear whether — as some news reports and analysts have speculated — police or Dorner set the fire intentionally, or if it was an accident precipitated, at least in part, by ammunition stores and various nonlethal tools available to police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dorner had been on the run for several days after waging something of a guerrilla warfare campaign against the LAPD, which he claimed wrongfully terminated him after he filed an excessive force complaint against his training officer, who is now a sergeant in the LAPD. The department claimed Dorner’s complaint was unfounded, and a Los Angeles court later upheld his firing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ex-cop posted a rambling manifesto that circulated shortly after he began his brazen, deadly attacks on people associated with the LAPD.

The department took criticism for that decision, as well as for shooting at numerous civilians in recent days whom officers suspected of being Dorner.",
