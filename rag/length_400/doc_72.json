(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bahrain's crown prince on Sunday declined an invitation to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding, saying he did not want the Gulf nation's unrest to tarnish the celebration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa sent his regrets to Prince Charles after questions emerged over the British monarchy's decision to invite a member of Bahrain's Sunni ruling family, which has waged a wide-ranging crackdown against Shiite protesters calling for more freedoms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bahrain's rulers have imposed martial law and are backed by a Saudi-led military force to try to quell the uprising.

Other foreign royals who are attending include kings, queens, princes and princesses from countries including Denmark, Norway, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Swaziland.
