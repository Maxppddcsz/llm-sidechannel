NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many of the 18 restaurants that took part in the program, started last year, said they have dropped out when contacted by Reuters on Thursday. Officials for the chain with 130 restaurants nationwide did not respond to requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bob Merritt, CEO of Houston-based parent company Ignite Restaurant Group, told investors this month that research indicated 60 percent of customers disliked the no-tipping policy, trade paper Nation’s Restaurant News reported this week.

The test was seen as groundbreaking for a major national chain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the test locations, Joe’s paid some workers a minimum of $12 an hour. The Houston-based company raised menu prices less than 20 percent to compensate for the higher labor costs.

An industry group added restaurant owners are required to make up any difference from tip income and hourly wages to meet federal minimum wage requirements.
