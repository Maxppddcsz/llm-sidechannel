NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the recording discovered on Dr. Conrad Murray’s iPhone, Jackson rambled to his doctor about his upcoming comeback concerts and plans to build a hospital for children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “God wants me to do it. I’m gonna do it, Conrad,” the singer said in slurred words. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I know you would,” Murray replied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conrad Murray witnesses: Who's who NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mumbling and at times incomprehensible, the singer went on to tell Murray what he had often said publicly -– that he related to children because his music career had interrupted his own youth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I love them because I didn’t have a childhood. I had no childhood. I feel their pain,” Jackson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murray replied “Mmm-mmm” repeatedly as Jackson spoke, and after the singer suddenly grew silent asked, “You OK?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am asleep,\" Jackson replied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors, who first revealed the existence of the recording in opening statements, maintain the May 10, 2009, recording proves Murray knew Jackson’s “state” but continued procuring drugs for him, including the anesthetic propofol which is blamed along with sedatives for his death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The recording was played during the testimony of a computer forensic expert who analyzed Murray’s iPhone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stephen Marx also recovered a second recording, a voicemail in which Jackson's manager told Murray his famous patient needed stepped-up medical treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the message left five days before Jackson’s death, manager Frank DiLeo asked the physician to call him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I’m sure you are aware he had an episode last night. He’s sick,” said DiLeo, who died earlier this year. “I think you may need to get a blood test on him. We got to see what he’s doing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jackson had missed a week of rehearsals and arrived at one practice too weak to perform, according to previous testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Murray faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson’s June 25, 2009, death. His defense contends the singer self-administered propofol and sedatives.
