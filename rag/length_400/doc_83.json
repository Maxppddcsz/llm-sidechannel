This time, the winner of the Nobel prize for literature has lashed out at female authors, saying there is no woman writer whom he considers his equal – and singling out Jane Austen for particular criticism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview at the Royal Geographic Society on Tuesday about his career, Naipaul, who has been described as the \"greatest living writer of English prose\", was asked if he considered any woman writer his literary match. He replied: \"I don't think so.\" Of Austen he said he \"couldn't possibly share her sentimental ambitions, her sentimental sense of the world\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He felt that women writers were \"quite different\". He said: \"I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not. I think [it is] unequal to me.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The author, who was born in Trinidad, said this was because of women's \"sentimentality, the narrow view of the world\". \"And inevitably for a woman, she is not a complete master of a house, so that comes over in her writing too,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added: \"My publisher, who was so good as a taster and editor, when she became a writer, lo and behold, it was all this feminine tosh. I don't mean this in any unkind way.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The criticism from the author is unsurprising. Naipaul is no stranger to criticism. In the past Naipaul has criticised India's top female authors for their \"banality\" on the topic he is best known for writing about, the legacy of British colonialism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had a long-running feud with US travel writer and author Paul Theroux. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their 30-year friendship came to a sudden end, after Theroux discovered that a book he gave Naipaul had been put on sale for £916. The comments were dismissed by the Writers Guild of Great Britain, which said it would not \"waste its breath on them\". Literary journalist Alex Clark said: \"Is he really saying that writers such as Hilary Mantel, AS Byatt, Iris Murdoch are sentimental or write feminine tosh?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Literary critic Helen Brown described them as \"arrogant, attention-seeking\".He should heed the words of George Eliot – a female writer – whose works have had a far more profound impact on world",
