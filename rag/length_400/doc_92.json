NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, the makers of the lewd card game you're afraid to tell your mother about wiped their online store clean, leaving only a page on which people could give them $5. Surprisingly, 1,199 people logged on and gave. In fact, one fellow gave $100 by repeatedly filling out the $5 payment form, the company wrote in a post on the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See also: Shocking new photos reveal that Princess Charlotte is very cute NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the company has a history of charitable giving, having donated over $4 million over the last few years (a fact they're not ashamed to make known), this time they decided to keep the windfall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They spent it on themselves in some, ahem, interesting ways and compiled a list of how exactly they divested themselves of their (your) money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: Cards Against Humanity NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unsurprisingly, the some of the most common purchases on the list were tech gadgets (mostly Apple products). After laptops and iPads were ticked off the must-have list, along with a few bottles of fine scotch, people unleashed their buying power to some strange places. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Intern Karlee, for example, bought the $3,120 (discounted from $3,900) YVA 24-karat gold personal pleasure massager. Tom paid $1,500 for LASIK eye surgery and another $384 for piano lessons. And Kara spent $1,607 on a trip to Disneyland for her little sister, while Trin paid a divorce attorney $3,524. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clearly, this spending exercise was about people picking up some bigger expenses outside their normal budgets. That said, many staffers set aside some money for charitable giving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jenn, for example, after buying a $1,200 bespoke Robin Hood costume, made a $798 donation to Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, which suffered a tragic shooting Friday. Four other staffers followed suit, donating either to regional Planned Parenthood organization or to the nationwide organization itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All things considered, it seems the Cards Against Humanity staff made fine use of their gift money and will certainly derive much pleasure from their purchases ... especially Karlee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether people would have given all that money knowing it would go to line the pockets of staffers is questionable, though no one can say they weren't warned.",
