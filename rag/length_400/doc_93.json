NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump Place apartment complex on Manhattan’s Upper West Side is about to drop the president-elect’s name after an outcry by residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The three rental buildings -- at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Blvd. -- will be renamed for their street addresses, landlord Equity Residential said Tuesday in an e-mail. “We are assuming a more neutral building identity that will appeal to all current and future residents,” the Chicago-based company said. The Trump Place name is emblazoned on the apartment buildings in gold letters, which are set to be removed this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost 600 people had signed an online petition urging the landlord to “Dump the Trump Name.” Equity Residential spokesman Marty McKenna said Tuesday that the company had a contractual obligation regarding the use of the name, and that the period of the contract has ended.

I tell them 180 Riverside Blvd.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amanda Miller, a Trump Organization vice president, said in an e-mail that the name change was mutually agreed upon and “simply the enforcement of a pre-existing agreement which has been in place for years.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In New York County, which is the island of Manhattan, 87 percent of votes cast in the presidential election were for Trump’s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, according to data compiled by Politico.
