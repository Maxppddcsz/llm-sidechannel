NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KFC is facing a $20 million lawsuit filed by an incensed customer who says she didn’t get enough chicken in her $20 “Fill-Up.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anna Wurtzburger, a 64-year-old retiree of Hudson Valley, N.Y., filed a lawsuit late last month claiming that KFC’s advertising is misleading.
