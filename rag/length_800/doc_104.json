NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since its debut in 1979, the Happy Meal has been a staple of McDonald's menu and a go-to meal option on family road trips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But some Canadian parents are decidedly unhappy about the hold the fast-food empire has over their children's stomachs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antonio Bramante is the lead plaintiff in a newly certified lawsuit that alleges McDonald's is unlawfully aiming advertising at children under 13 years of age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That would violate the province's strict youth consumer protection laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Bramante, a father of three young children, says he eats at McDonald's about once every two weeks on the urging of his children, according to the court documents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He estimates he has spent hundreds of dollars on Happy Meals, which are children's meals that come with toys. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Quebec father says the toys are often linked to popular film releases and his children often want to return to the restaurant so they can complete their set of toys. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also claims the restaurant is directly targeting children by displaying the Happy Meals toys at their eye level.

And what's the easiest thing to give into? It's to feed your children,\" says Joey Zukran, the Montreal-based lawyer who filed the class action on Mr Bramante's behalf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Quebec prohibits marketing to children under the age of 13, making it one of a handful of jurisdictions in the world to essentially ban all advertising geared towards children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The province has also had a law since 1980 that restricts marketing unhealthy food to children.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Zukran says he is ready to argue McDonald's is not covered by any of these exceptions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Quebec court judge issued a ruling certifying the lawsuit last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anyone who purchased a McDonald's Happy Meal in Quebec from November 2013, even if they are not Canadian residents, can request to be part of the class action, Mr Zukran says.
