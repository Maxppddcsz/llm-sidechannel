NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hours after the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, broke the news, the king explained his decision on Spanish television and radio. He highlighted his pride in the \"transformation of Spain\" and the \"tremendous amount achieved by all\" since the country's transition into democracy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today, when I look back, I cannot help but feel pride and gratitude towards all of you,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Felipe and his wife, Letizia.

His son Felipe, he assured Spaniards, \"has the maturity, preparation, and sense of responsibility necessary to assume the title of head of state and open a new era of hope which combines the experience and momentum of a new generation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once one of the world's most popular monarchs, more recently Juan Carlos has been plagued by a series of scandals that have sent his popularity plummeting. A poll by El Mundo last year found that nearly two-thirds of Spaniards thought the king should abdicate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In contrast, Prince Felipe, a former Olympic yachtsman, has come out relatively unscathed. Frequently photographed while taking their two daughters to school or at shopping malls, Felipe and his wife Letizia Ortiz - a former television news anchor - have cultivated an image of leading a relatively modest lifestyle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fluent in English, French and Catalan along with Spanish, Felipe studied for a year in Canada before undertaking three years of military training in Spain's army, navy and air force academy. A law degree in Madrid soon followed, as well as a Masters in international relations at Georgetown University in Washington, DC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"His goal, his only goal, is to serve Spain. It has been deeply ingrained in him that he must be the country's main servant,\" his mother Queen Sofia once said.

Taking the throne just two days after the death of Franco in 1975, Juan Carlos won the respect of Spaniards by steering the country from dictatorship to democracy, including foiling a coup attempt in 1981. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as Spain fell into financial crisis, the king's standing sank. A particularly low point came when it was revealed that he had taken a luxurious trip to Botswana to hunt elephants, just weeks after telling a reporter that he was so distraught about the growing ranks of the unemployed that he was having trouble sleeping.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many, particularly young Spaniards, began to see the king as part of Spain's problems, drawing parallels between him and the economic and political powers that had driven the country into the economic crisis. While the king's approval rating dropped steadily, that of his son Felipe remained stable at around 66%, leading many to suggest that the monarchy would be better off if the king abdicated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Monday's announcement, Rajoy praised Juan Carlos, calling him a \"tireless defender of our interests\". He added: \"I'm convinced this is the best moment for change.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spain is now expected to change its constitution to make sure Felipe's first-born daughter Leonor can succeed him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The royal family has said its wants the change to ensure she is next in line to the throne in the event that Felipe's wife gets pregnant again and gives birth to a boy, who would become monarch under the current constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysts say that could open the door to political negotiations for additional proposed constitutional changes, including demands by the leading opposition Socialist Party to grant Catalonia more autonomy or special financial benefits to ease separatist feelings.
