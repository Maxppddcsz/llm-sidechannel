(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Facing the possibility of prison at 81, Bill Cosby arrived at a suburban Philadelphia courthouse Tuesday to learn his punishment for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman over a decade ago in what led to the first celebrity trial of the #MeToo era. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors on Monday asked a judge to give the comedian five to 10 years behind bars, while his lawyers asked for house arrest, saying the legally blind Cosby is too old and helpless to do time in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt said the former TV star planned to remain silent when given the opportunity to address the court. Cosby did not testify at either of his two trials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The once-beloved entertainer dubbed America's Dad for his role as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the top-ranked, 1980s-era \"Cosby Show\" faced anywhere from probation to 10 years in prison for violating Temple University women's basketball administrator Andrea Constand at his estate near Philadelphia in 2004. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the years since Constand first went to authorities in 2005, more than 60 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, though none of those claims have led to criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday's sentencing was a reckoning accusers and prosecutors said was decades in the making. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The victims cannot be un-raped. Unfortunately, all we can do is hold the perpetrator accountable,\" said Gianna Constand, the victim's mother, who testified Monday that her daughter's buoyant personality was forever changed after the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing was set to conclude Tuesday after testimony from a defense psychologist who says Cosby is no longer a danger, given his age, and should not be branded a \"sexually violent predator.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Defense lawyer Joseph Green Jr. urged the judge ignore the protests and activism surrounding the case and send Cosby home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The suggestion that Mr. Cosby is dangerous is not supported by anything other than the frenzy,\" Green said as demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Being labeled a sexually violent predator would make Cosby subject to mandatory lifetime counseling and community notification of his whereabouts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, Kristen Dudley, a psychologist for the state of Pennsylvania, testified that Cosby fits the criteria for a sexually violent predator, showing signs of a mental disorder that involves an uncontrollable urge to have nonconsensual sex with young women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said Cosby would no doubt commit similar crimes if given the chance, warning that the former TV star seemingly gets a sexual thrill out of slipping women drugs and assaulting them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"To say that he's too old to do that — to say that he should get a pass, because it's taken this long to catch up to what he's done?\" Steele said, his voice rising. \"What they're asking for is a 'get out of jail free' card.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby, he said, has shown repeatedly that he feels no remorse over his actions. And he said the sentence should send a message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Despite bullying tactics, despite PR teams and other folks trying to change the optics, as one lawyer for the defense put it, the bottom line is that nobody's above the law. Nobody,\" the district attorney said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After testifying for several hours at two trials, the first of which ended in a hung jury, Constand spoke in court Monday for just two minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The jury heard me. Mr. Cosby heard me. Now all I am asking for is justice as the court sees fit,\" said Andrea Constand, who submitted a much longer victim-impact statement that wasn't read in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The AP does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, which Constand and other accusers have done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby's side didn't call any character witnesses, and his wife of 54 years, Camille, was not in court Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby became the first black actor to star in a prime-time TV show, \"I Spy,\" in 1965. He remained a Hollywood A-lister for much of the next half-century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The proceedings took place as another extraordinary #MeToo drama continued to unfold on Capitol Hill, where Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces allegations of sexual misconduct from more than three decades ago.
