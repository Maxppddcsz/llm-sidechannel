(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) â€” A judge declared Bill Cosby a \"sexually violent predator\" on Tuesday as a first step toward sentencing the 81-year-old comedian for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman over a decade ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The classification means that Cosby must undergo monthly counseling for the rest of his life and report quarterly to authorities. His name will appear on a sex-offender registry sent to neighbors, schools and victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Montgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill made the decision as he prepared to sentence Cosby for violating Temple University women's basketball administrator Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate in 2004. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comic once known as America's Dad faced anywhere from probation to 10 years in prison after being convicted in April in the first celebrity trial of the #MeToo era. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors asked for five to 10 years in prison. The defense requested house arrest, saying Cosby is too old and helpless to do time behind bars. He is legally blind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby's lawyers had fought the \"sexually violent predator\" designation, arguing that Pennsylvania's sex-offender law remains unconstitutional and that he is no threat to the public at his age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But O'Neill said prosecutors had met their burden of proof by \"clear and convincing\" evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the ruling came down, a woman in courtroom shot her fist into the air and whispered, \"Yessss!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, Constand said in a statement submitted to the ocurt and released Tuesday that she has had to cope with years of anxiety and self-doubt that have left her \"stuck in a holding pattern.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Constand, 45, said her training as a professional basketball player had led her to think she could handle anything, but \"life as I knew it\" ended on the night that Cosby knocked her out with pills and violated her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Constand said she now lives alone with her two dogs and has trouble trusting people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When the sexual assault happened, I was a young woman brimming with confidence and looking forward to a future bright with possibilities,\" she wrote in her five-page statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Now, almost 15 years later, I'm a middle-aged woman who's been stuck in a holding pattern for most of her adult life, unable to heal fully or to move forward.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the years since Constand first went to authorities in 2005, more than 60 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, though none of those claims have led to criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge ruled on Cosby's sex-offender status after a defense psychologist, Timothy Foley, testified that the chances of the comedian committing another sex offense are \"extraordinarily low\" because he is old, legally blind and needs help getting around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, a psychologist for the state testified that Cosby appears to have a mental disorder that gives him an uncontrollable urge to assault women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby was smiling and joking with his spokesman and sheriff's deputies as he settled into the courtroom Tuesday. On Day 1 of the sentencing, the comic laughed at times as the psychologist on the stand for the state portrayed him as a sexual predator with signs of a mental disorder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cameras were not allowed in the courtroom; they are generally banned in Pennsylvania. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt said the former TV star planned to remain silent when given the opportunity to address the court. Cosby did not testify at either of his two trials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The proceedings took place as another extraordinary #MeToo drama continued to unfold on Capitol Hill, where Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh faces allegations of sexual misconduct from more than three decades ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday's sentencing was a reckoning accusers and prosecutors said was decades in the making for the once-beloved entertainer known for his role as wise and understanding Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the top-ranked, 1980s-era \"Cosby Show.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The AP does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, which Constand and other accusers have done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cosby became the first black actor to star in a prime-time TV show, \"I Spy,\" in 1965. He remained a Hollywood A-lister for much of the next half-century.
