NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Explaining his decision for her to be given life-saving treatment that neither she nor her family want, he said: “We only live once – we are born once and we die once – and the difference between life and death is the biggest difference we know.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge said it was the first time he had dealt with a case in which providing life-sustaining treatment might not be in the “best interest” of a patient who was “fully aware” of their condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judgment will increase debate about whether the authorities should step in to prevent people with serious illnesses from choosing to end their lives. There have been growing calls for assisted suicide to be legalised despite concerns that people who express a wish to die may change their view. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Evan Harris, the former Liberal Democrat MP and member of the British Medical Association’s ethics committee, said it was a “very controversial judgment”. “The implications of force-feeding are really significant because she would need restraining or sedation and the treatment would last a year,” he said. “It might not succeed and is itself life-threatening. To impose that on a patient who might be competent in refusing treatment is a very major step.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Peter Saunders, the campaign director of Care Not Killing, which lobbies against assisted suicide, welcomed the ruling. “The judge has made a wise and courageous decision,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In so doing he has emphasised that all human life is deserving of profound respect and strong protection, and also that acting in the best interests of people who are lacking capacity does not always mean acceding to their demands.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unnamed patient, from Wales, was described as a highly talented and intelligent woman who held ambitions of having a family and becoming a doctor before she became seriously ill in her mid-twenties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She twice signed forms last year saying she did not want to be given treatment to keep her alive. She told the judge through a senior barrister that she felt her life was “pure torment” and that all her efforts to recover had failed. She now wants a “peaceful death”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judgment read: “She understands that she will die without intervention. She does not want to be killed, she just wants to be allowed to act as she wants. It is possible that she might change her mind, but not because somebody forces her to do so.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The woman’s parents told the court they had given up hope that their daughter could recover. They said: “It upsets us greatly to advocate for our daughter’s right to die. We love her dearly but feel that our role should now be to fight for her best interests, which, at this time, we strongly feel should be the right to choose her own path, free from restraint and fear of enforced re-feed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We feel she has suffered enough. She stands no hope of achieving the things that she would value in her life and shows no signs of revising these aspirations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Justice Jackson, who sits at the Court of Protection in London, indicated that the case was one of the most difficult he had encountered. He said the woman — identified only as “E” — stood only a 20 per cent chance of recovery even if she was put on an invasive force-feeding programme that would last at least a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “E’s case has raised for the first time in my experience the real possibility of life-sustaining treatment not being in the best interests of a person who, while lacking capacity, is fully aware of her situation,” the judge said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, he concluded: “E is a special person, whose life is of value. She does not see it that way now, but she may in future. I would not overrule her wishes if further treatment was futile, but it is not. Although extremely burdensome to E, there is a possibility that it will succeed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The woman’s illness dates back to her childhood. She suffered serious sexual abuse between the ages of four and 11, unknown to her parents. At 12 or 13 she began binge eating and forcing herself to vomit, and started to drink alcohol. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When she was 15 she was admitted to a specialist adolescent eating disorder unit, and later began a medical degree. However, she began drinking heavily after a bad relationship and dropped out of university. Between",
