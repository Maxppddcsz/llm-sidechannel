NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spunky, clever and enterprising, Wadjda is a determined and sweet-natured girl who simply wants to do what most kids do: race around on a bike with her pals. But in her Saudi culture that's forbidden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waad Mohammed stars in 'Wadjda,' the first feature film to be shot entirely in Saudi Arabia. (Photo: Tobias Kownatzki, Sony Pictures Classics) Story Highlights USA TODAY review: ***½ out of 4 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stars: Waad Mohammed, Reem Abdullah, Sultan Al Assaf, Abdullrahman Al Gohani NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rated PG; runtime: 1 hour, 38 minutes; opens Friday in select cities NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A green bicycle is the vehicle that draws viewers down the byways of a repressive culture in the deeply affecting Wadjda (***½; rated PG; opening Friday in select cities). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's a groundbreaking film on a couple of levels: The first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, it was made by that nation's first female director, Haifaa Al Mansour.Wadjda is a winning and wonderfully moving tale of an endearing 10-year-old girl, living in a suburb of Riyadh, making her voice heard in a patriarchal society that seeks to silence her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not only is this a deftly crafted and superbly acted film, but Wadjda sheds a powerful light on what women face, starting in childhood, in an oppressive regime. However, it never comes across like a sociological lecture. Its message is clear, but told with engaging understatement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A plucky, creative girl who subtly becomes a non-conformist rebel, Wadjda (Waad Mohammed) has the same desire as most kids around the world: to ride a bicycle. What is hard for Western audiences to absorb is why the simple act of riding a bike is anathema for girls in Islamic culture. So many accepted notions seem startlingly restrictive. \"A woman's voice reveals her nakedness,\" says a teacher who chides Wadjda for laughing on the playground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR VIDEO: Saudi Arabia More Tolerant, Says Woman Film Maker NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR REVIEWS: The latest movie reviews from USA TODAY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRAILERS: Coming soon to theaters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wadjda's determination to buy a bike and race it against the boy who lives next door, Abdullah (Abdullrahman Al Gohani), is inspired during a wonderfully evocative scene where she sees a green bicycle skimming along, atop a moving car hidden by a wall. It's a magical moment where the bike seems powered by something mystical. Wadjda is instantly smitten. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A smart, fun-loving girl with impressive entrepreneurial skills, she's branded as undisciplined by authorities at her conservative Muslim school because of her casual defiance of traditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Wadjda expresses a desire to participate in a Quran recitation contest, the principal thinks she's gotten through to the boundary-pushing Wadjda. But Wadjda has her eye on the prize money. Her plan is to win and buy the bike of her dreams. No matter that girls do not ride bikes in Saudi Arabia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Wadjda practices her recitations, her mother (Reem Abdullah) faces her own challenges stemming from a patriarchal society. Her modes of transportation are equally restrictive. Women are not allowed to drive and she is dependent on a nasty, irresponsible driver she hires to get to work. Neither mother nor daughter can travel in ways that would improve their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waad Mohammed, 12, is wonderfully natural as young Wadjda, and Abdullah as her mother gives a memorably nuanced performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wadjda is resolute about resisting the status quo, but in a cheeky way that is consistent with the behavior of a 10-year-old. We sense she will go on to push against social strictures as she grows up. A compassionate soul, she sees the divide between the free-wheeling world her father (Sultan Al Assaf) inhabits and the confined one of her mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Al Mansour has crafted a vividly multidimensional film that sidesteps predictability. She does not paint the men or boys in the film with a broad, villainous brush. Characters are believably drawn. The limitations that Saudi women must endure are depicted modestly, but powerfully. And it's never a bitter pill — the film has some charmingly humorous moments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her emotional tale of a child and a bike, Al Mansour also pays tribute to the 1949 Italian neo-realist classic The Bicycle Thief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This disarming tale of a likable young girl is at once eye-opening, fascinating and profoundly poignant.
