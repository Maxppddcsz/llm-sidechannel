    "0": "Computer hackers associated with the hacktivist group Anonymous released a recording on YouTube Wednesday that they claim are audio files from a St. Louis County Police dispatch recorded during the Aug. 9 shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tape appears to be from St. Louis County dispatch — but the officer who fired the shots works for Ferguson's police department. Discussion of the shooting begins at 11:26, when a dispatcher mentions hearing about the incident \"on the news,\" and at minute 44, which contains audio from 1:35 p.m. - 2:05 p.m., the dispatcher says \"we are switching over to the riot channel.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's likely any chatter regarding the actual shooting will be found in the Ferguson Police Department's audio dispatches. Those have yet to be released — Ferguson's Police Chief Thomas Jackson says the 911 tapes were still being processed during a press conference on Wednesday, and apologized that it was taking so long. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reached over email, St. Louis Police spokesperson Brian Schellman tells Mashable, \"We are aware of this and are currently investigating it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked if he has any indication if they were real, or any clue how they were obtained, Schellman responded, \"That's what our investigators are looking into now. The answer to both of those questions.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The St. Louis County Police Department is currently in charge of the shooting's investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BREAKING: #Anonymous has obtained audio files of police dispatch and EMS during the #MikeBrown shooting. Will release ASAP. #Ferguson — TheAnonMessage (@TheAnonMessage) August 13, 2014 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have released these tapes to the public so as they are able to get a sense of the atmosphere the moments before and the hours after Mike Brown was shot,\" an Anonymous spokesperson associated with the leaks told Mashable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The public needs to understand that there were faults in the response to Mike Brown's shooting. For example, crowd control was requested but there was no mention of a shooting. The dispatcher was notified from a caller and Ferguson PD said they had no idea what was going on. This is all in the tapes,\" the spokesperson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group explains the scanner audio, which is almost two hours long, was lightly edited to remove quiet periods in its description on YouTube: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We are Anonymous. These files compiled in this video contains audio of St. Louis police dispatch from the date of August 9th 2014, the day Mike Brown was murdered by a Ferguson PD officer. We have released these tapes to the public so as they are able to get a sense of the atmosphere the moments before and the hours after Mike Brown was shot. These raw audio files have been compiled and long quiet moments have been cut down. Time stamps are available within the video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group had promised to release the tapes on Wednesday, but ran into technical problems uploading the tape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We apologize for the delay, file size is rather large. Continue to stay tuned in, we will notify you immediately,\" the Twitter account @TheAnonMessage message tweeted just after 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday. \"It's not my fault YouTube servers take forever to process.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The website of the St. Louis suburb has also been experiencing cyberattacks since the shooting, but Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said on Wednesday that those won't sway him into releasing the officer's name who shot Brown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The officer has not been identified, though Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said the officer had been with the Ferguson police force for six years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jackson said someone burrowed into the website and shut it down for much of Monday, two days after the 18-year-old Brown was killed. Brown's death has stoked racial tensions, violent protests, and looting, along with calls for police to release the offending officer's name so his background could be reviewed.

But Jackson said releasing the information could endanger the officer, who has received numerous death threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jackson said he was unaware of whether the hackers obtained any personal information about police officers from its website. Ferguson, a predominantly black city of roughly 20,000 residents, is about 8 miles northwest of St. Louis.
