NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Weinstein Company NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After some shocking oversights with last weekend's Golden Globes contenders and some surprising nods from the Screen Actors Guild , the big day has arrived: the Academy Award nominations are in!As usual, some of the year's frontrunners and favorites of critics and moviegoers alike didn't wake up to congratulatory messages. Most notably, no actors of color were tapped in the individual acting categories – the second year in a row From Johnny Depp to Straight Outta Compton, here's who and what was left out in the cold for the Oscars, which airs on Feb. 28.Straight Outta Compton was only recognized for Best Original Screenplay after surprise nominations at this season's other award derbies.The snub further exemplifies the lack of diversity among this year's top categories.The pint-size Room star scored a nomination from the Screen Actors Guild but was ignored at last weekend's Golden Globes and, now, by the Academy.At only 9, a nomination for Jacob Tremblay would have set him up to be the youngest person ever to win an Academy Award. Helen Mirren 's portrayal of gossip columnist Hedda Hopper in Trumbo earned her nods from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and the Screen Actors Guild, but, unfortunately she won't face off against Rachel McAdams and Alicia Vikander.Mirren's costar Bryan Cranston , however, is nominated for his turn as the blacklisted screenwriter.Elba's portrayal of a West African battalion leader in Netflix's first feature film offering Beasts of No Nation seemed like a sure thing.Unfortunately, Cary Joji Fukunaga's gripping drama received no love from the Academy.While Sylvester Stallone has received an overwhelming amount of love for reprising his role as Rocky Balboa in Creed, the film's lead actor has been shut out of the award circuit. Jordan may be one of Hollywood's most promising rising stars, but this is the second time the 28-year-old actor has been overlooked by the Academy – he was snubbed for his breakout role in Fruitvale in 2013. Now, despite his impressive physical transformation in Creed – and the film's impressive $106 million domestic haul – he's been ignored again.Stewart received the French equivalent of the Oscar, the Cesar Award, in December 2014 for Clouds of Sils Maria. Her Best Supporting Actress trophy was the first time an American woman has ever been given the honor, so it's a surprise the Academy didn't follow suit.While 99 Homes was a sleeper hit when it was released this past September, Shannon's portrayal of a merciless real-estate broker was recognized by the Screen Actors Guild.Instead, Sylvester Stallone 's latest turn as the iconic Rocky Balboa nabbed the coveted fifth spot at the Oscars.Depp will not be up for an Academy Award, despite an eerie transformation into Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger in Black Mass and early raves for his menacing performance.While the beloved Inside Out – a big winner at the Golden Globes – scored a nod, Pixar's other 2015 offering, The Good Dinosaur, did not.The movie was Pixar and Disney's second offering of 2015 – up next is Finding Dory, the Finding Nemo spin-off, and then the third Cars installment. 2017's Coco will be the next completely new story from the studio.While Carol's stars Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett scored individual nominations, the film – an assumed shoo-in for Best Picture – was left off the list of eight.Instead, Bridge of Spies – which wasn't recognized in the picture category by either the Hollywood Foreign Press Association or the Screen Actors Guild – nabbed a coveted spot.While Scott's The Martian was tapped with a Best Picture nomination and a Best Actor nod for Matt Damon, the director wasn't among the five names released on Thursday.Scott has been nominated three times in the category – for Thelma and Louise, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, with no wins.Going Clear was something of a phenomenon when it debuted on HBO in 2015. The documentary, which examined life inside the Church of Scientology, garnered a ton of attention and even inspired an Saturday Night Live spoof – despite backlash from the church.While he's garnered lots of love from the Academy in years past, Tarantino went largely unnoticed for his latest effort, The Hateful Eight The auteur has been previously nominated five times, including two wins for Best Original Screenplay, but went largely overlooked this year.
