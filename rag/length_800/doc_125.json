NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the debate, to be hosted by MSNBC, was first proposed by the New Hampshire Union Leader, the paper would have a decreased presence at the DNC's request as the party tries to reassert control over a debate process that has become chaotic in recent days. Sources said the committee wants the Union Leader to stand down in part because it has already cosponsored a Democratic debate with ABC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Union Leader would still be involved, likely by contributing some questions from the paper's subscribers, but would not be technical \"co-sponsors\" for branding and the like. Sources said the paper was willing to sacrifice its involvement to make sure the debate happened. The plans, the sources stressed, are still in flux. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The debate would be moderated by MSNBC hosts Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Union Leader, MSNBC and the DNC declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders’ campaigns have agreed in principle to attend four more debates, starting with the proposed New Hampshire event next week, a Clinton campaign aide confirmed Saturday — but an exchange of statements on Saturday called the Feb. 4 date into question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both campaigns, and Martin O'Malley's, spent Friday negotiating with the DNC, which has not publicly weighed in on the campaigns’ requests to add the four events — one in February, one in March, one in April, and one in May — since Sanders proposed it this week. The final details are still being ironed out, and no dates or locations have been solidified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The step forward came after days of wrangling in public and behind the scenes, as the two major Democratic candidates sought to pressure each other on the topic of adding debates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the Sanders campaign, with its latest statement on Saturday afternoon, suggested the New Hampshire debate won't happen unless the rest of the schedule is agreed upon. So the New Hampshire debate, at the moment, is on hold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"After refusing for months to participate in more debates, Secretary Clinton requested that the Democratic National Committee rules be changed and that a new debate take place in New Hampshire next week,\" Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said. \"We agreed pending an agreement on three future debates in March, April and May. Unfortunately, the Clinton campaign has not accepted debates we proposed on March 3 in Michigan and April 14 in New York. They apparently agreed to May 24 in California. The Clinton campaign, after not accepting Michigan, now says they want it. We are pleased to do it on March 3 before the Michigan primary provided the Clinton campaign will agree to Brooklyn, New York, on April 14. Why won't they debate in Brooklyn? What's the matter with Brooklyn?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta soon responded, suggesting that Clinton would be at the New Hampshire event regardless of Sanders' involvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are prepared to show up for a debate next Thursday and for three additional debates in the months ahead, which we can all work together to schedule. We hope Senator Sanders will be there too,\" he said in a statement on Saturday night. \"If the Sanders campaign decides to reject the debate next week, we’ll let them answer to the voters of New Hampshire.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly before Weaver's statement, Clinton had proposed a debate in Flint, Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sanders, O’Malley, and Democratic activists had long made an issue of the previously scant debate schedule — just six events, and only four before Iowa and New Hampshire vote; trailing in New Hampshire, Clinton tried to push Sanders into agreeing to the event there after the New Hampshire Union Leader and MSNBC earlier this week announced an unsanctioned event would be held there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sanders responded by proposing the additional debates, which now seem likely to occur if the DNC signs on. The committee would have to waive its exclusivity clause that precludes candidates from appearing in unsanctioned debates and bars them from joining the official events if they do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next official debate is in Milwaukee on February 11, two days after the New Hampshire primary. the February, — in manager wants DNC's newspaper, and will before candidates",
