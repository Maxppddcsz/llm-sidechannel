NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think Peterson is the lowest form of life available,\" said Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was gunned down on the third floor. \"My daughter would be alive if not for him.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel publicly criticized Peterson for his inaction during the shooting that left 17 dead and others wounded, but he didn't fire the 54-year-old deputy, instead allowing him to resign. Local 10 News caught up with Peterson outside his home in Boynton Beach, where he is living on his $100,000-a-year public pension. The deputy, who had yet to face any media, simply turned and hurried inside, saying only, \"Don't come on my property.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But now, a report that recently surfaced has some victims' families calling for a renewed investigation of Peterson for a case he handled four years to the day prior to the massacre. The case involved two 17-year-old students bullying a 14-year-old freshman, with one holding down the younger boy by his ankles while the other kicked the victim, grabbed his genitals and then took the victim's own baseball bat and began shoving it against his buttocks, simulating rape, through the boy's clothes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of those assailants, the boy who allegedly held down the victim, was Israel's son, Brett. Defense attorney Alex Arreaza, who represents shooting victim Anthony Borges, who was shot five times in the Valentine's Day massacre but survived, said the case could have led to felony charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He could be charged with a lewd and lascivious, and I'm being conservative,\" Arreaza said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peterson claims in the report that it was a \"simple battery\" under the board's discipline matrix, and he decided to give both of the boy's attackers a three-day suspension. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What is that? Is that like an alternative universe law?\" Arreaza said. \"What happens? Because you're in the school you don't have to obey regular laws?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, the disciplinary matrix includes \"sexual misconduct\" and \"serious\" battery, both of which, arguably, apply in this case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You will never see somebody grabbing somebody's crotch and poking some kid in the butt with a bat and getting a simple battery for it,\" Arreaza said when asked if he believed the sheriff's son received preferential treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Local 10 relayed the facts of the incident to him for the first time, Guttenberg said it \"infuriated\" him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Scot Peterson failed to do his job again,\" he said. \"It's just another example of a bad crime and somebody not being held accountable. It's kind of interesting the intersection of the same people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was also killed on the third floor at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the case appears to be another incident of undue leniency for students accused of crimes, much of it stemming from the controversial PROMISE program designed to keep minors out of jail. The school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, never faced any charges despite numerous incidents inside and outside of school, including one that led to a referral to the PROMISE program, with which Superintendent Robert Runcie claimed Cruz had never been associated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pollack also said he believed Peterson's handling of the incident may have provided Peterson job security at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[Peterson] was lazy and this could have given him protection to keep his job at the school during those four years,\" Pollack said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a written statement, Borges' father, Royer Borges, said, \"Maybe if Deputy Peterson would have been made to answer for this, he may have been replaced by a more competent deputy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If this wouldn't have been the sheriff's son, would a sexual assault have been reduced to a simple battery?\" he went on to say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peterson noted in his report that the victim's parents were notified of the discipline and \"did not request additional law enforcement action.\" The mother of the victim confirmed this to Local 10, saying the family members only wanted to put the matter behind them and that her son had made peace with the sheriff's son. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel didn't reply to multiple requests for comment from Local 10. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Borges and Guttenberg said they believe Peterson's handling of the assault should be investigated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't care if it was four days ago or four years ago,\" Guttenberg said. \"If people didn't do their job and they",
