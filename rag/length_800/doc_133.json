NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The so-called \"Complete Cure Device\" draws blood from a patient, breaks down the disease and returns the purified blood back to the body, according to Dr. Ihsan Hanfy Hussein, a member of Abdel-Atti's research team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said it cures the ailments in as little as 16 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I will take the AIDS from the patient and I will nourish the patient on the AIDS treatment. I will give it to him like a skewer of Kofta to nourish him,\" Abdel-Atti said, referring to a dish made of ground meat.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Gamal Shiha, a leading liver specialist and member of a team evaluating a controversial device developed by Egypt's military for detecting hepatitis C without drawing blood from a patient, said the announcement shocked him and his colleagues.

There is nothing published, and there is nothing in medical conferences, and there is no single eminent professor around the project,\" Shiha told CNN. \"Nothing scientifically relevant has been said.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the military led the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy last year, a cult-like loyalty to the country's army and its chief, El-Sisi, triggered a new era of repression that has claimed hundreds of lives, suppressed organized opposition, and jailed journalists and activists, according to human rights groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Against a backdrop of fear, scientific justification appears secondary to some.

This will benefit all of humanity and solve a crisis that the medical community has not been able to fix for years. This is something we should celebrate,\" Maha Salim, a state media reporter, said on private network Tahrir TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lack of skepticism inside the restive country will do little to shield it from a medical community demanding evidence and answers.
