    "0": "The brain trust at Boeing, among the city's largest companies and a global aerospace and defense powerhouse, must cringe every time President-elect Donald Trump riffs on foreign policy, especially when it comes to dealing with China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Admittedly, that's my supposition because Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO, has made only measured comments about the administration's emerging international views. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But count on a mercurial Trump administration to test the Boeing CEO's statesmanship, especially when it comes to dealing with China — a multibillion-dollar Boeing commercial airline customer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It looks like Trump is eager for a China confrontation. This week, he launched a Twitter barrage chiding that country's trade, monetary and political policies. His comments came after he participated in a controversial phone call with the leader of Taiwan that China — which considers the island a rebel province — viewed as an insult. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The last thing Boeing, with $96 billion in annual revenues, wants is an international trade war that could raise tariffs or greatly disrupt long-standing, albeit imperfect, global agreements. Boeing risks retaliation and facing greater state-backed overseas competition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, in remarks before the Illinois Manufacturers' Association last week, Muilenburg conceded there's more populist concern about international pacts than before the 2016 election campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm not a political pundit or prognosticator — we have too many of those — but anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Muilenburg argues that international trade is essential to the U.S. economy and its importance is reflected in the \"large and growing percentage of our business\" coming from international sales, including commercial jet orders from China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world. One in every 3 of those 737s were bound for China. And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries … were bound for Chinese customers. This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985,\" said Muilenburg, who began his Boeing career as an aerospace engineer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A steady influx of China commercial jet orders means more work for Boeing's thousands of U.S. workers while also providing lift for its network of domestic parts supplier and vendors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Around 90 percent of Boeing's total workforce of 151,000 people and 80 percent of its thousands of suppliers are U.S.-based, according to Boeing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, Boeing racked up $66 billion in revenues from its commercial aircraft business. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while international sales grow, so does the competition. Boeing is up against European rival Airbus while Canada, Brazil, Russia — and yes, China — are trying to get pieces of the aerospace business. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Muilenburg suggests the Trump team, and Congress, back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric and perceived threats to punish other countries with higher tariffs or fees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, he suggests they get down to the business of advocating a stronger U.S. agenda during ongoing or upcoming trade negotiations with other countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,\" he said.

(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The big unknown is Trump, who hasn't seen a major trade deal he likes yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, a U.S. pact with Mexico and Canada, and wants to withdraw from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has blasted these deals for enabling U.S. companies to export work to less-expensive countries, hurting American workers. He also says too many countries are dumping cheap, government-subsidized steel and other goods into the U.S., which depresses demand for U.S.-made products and hurts job creation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As President-elect Donald Trump's tweet puts Air Force One in the headlines, here's a look at the presidential plane through the years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How nationalist will his new administration actually be and what form will that protectionism will take? Does that mean higher tariffs, sanctions, backing out of trade deals or more drastic measures? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Going into the next presidential administration, there's a lot of unanswered questions and concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Right now, Boeing's CEO is",
