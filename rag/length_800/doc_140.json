NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's patio stones, it's the square patio stones, we made like a four, we didn't want her to be on the grass when she was sitting in there playing,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecution asked Cindy Anthony to outline what kind of life Caylee Anthony was living at her grandparents' home with her mother, Casey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point during the testimony, Cindy Anthony asked the judge to take Caylee's picture down from her monitor so she could try to testify without crying.
