Send tips/suggestions to [email protected] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bob Dylan has a new whiskey brand—but he's gotta defend the brand name in court. More on that below, along with details on Oprah's latest Kraft Heinz collaboration and what major U.S. beer brand is now bigger in China than it is in America. Also, find out how major cosmetics brands are having a hard time keeping up with the Kardashians. But first, some trademark news that might make you L.O.L. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 411 on P&G; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you thought all those texting acronyms couldn't be yanked out of the digital commons and trademarked, forget that. Procter & Gamble Co. has filed for trademarks on household and personal-care use of LOL, WTF, NBD and FML. FWIW, there's no indication products bearing those names exist yet, and P&G; doesn't have trademark approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has sought clarifications from P&G;, which has until January to respond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Credit: Procter & Gamble Co. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Precise uses remain TBD, as P&G; declined to provide TMI. But competitors who might want to use these acronyms may now face FOMO. BTW, despite those old untrue P&G-Satanism; rumors, NBC reported in 2012 that LOL does NOT secretly stand for \"Lucifer Our Lord.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This Bud's for China NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Budweiser might be stuck in a long-term sales slide in the U.S.—but the King of Beers is surging in China. In fact, more Bud is consumed in China today than in the U.S., according to a new report from Rabobank citing figures from GlobalData. An AB InBev spokeswoman confirmed the accuracy of the data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Turning the brewer's classic American brands into international powerhouses has been a priority ever since Belgium-based InBev acquired St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch in 2008, creating AB InBev. Rabobank credits the brewer's multichannel strategy in China, including distributing beer through modern retail stores like Hema and Super Species, as well as its advertising on platforms including Weibo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Revlon can't keep up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was long that lingering suspicion that in the circular logic of social celebrity, the Kardashians were famous only for being famous. Well forget that. They now can be famous for wrecking much of the mass cosmetics business last quarter. Tarang Amin, CEO of cosmetics marketer E.L.F., earlier this month cited \"growth of mega-influencer-driven brands\" in part for somewhat disappointing top-line results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Without naming names, the two top mega-influencers in cosmetics over the past 18 months have been Kylie Jenner (Kylie Cosmetics) and Kim Kardashian West (KKW Cosmetics). Coty (CoverGirl) and Revlon posted declining North American mass cosmetics sales last quarter, and while they didn't blame the Kardashian-Jenner industrial complex, it probably took a toll. Forbes recently pegged Jenner's net worth $900 million, $800 million of which stems from the cosmetics. She may be having a bigger effect on packaged goods than sister Kendall did with that Pepsi video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Knockin' on the courtroom door NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like many celebrities, Bob Dylan has his own liquor, a whiskey brand named Heaven's Door that he launched earlier this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heavens Door whiskey NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But now the folk singer must defend the brand name from a legal challenge brought by Heaven Hill Distilleries, which says the name sounds too similar to its Heaven Hill whiskey. The Louisville Courier Journal has more on the trademark infringement lawsuit that was filed last week in federal court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Super sized pasta NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Olive Garden's Never Ending Pasta Pass—weeks of all-you-can-eat pasta, plus soup or salad and breadsticks for about $100—goes on sale Aug. 23. This year, apparently in honor of America's, ahem, growing appetite for the offer, there's an even more gluttonous version. Olive Garden plans to sell 1,000 52-week passes, for $300 each plus tax. The more traditional Never Ending Pasta Pass, which lasts eight weeks, is $100 plus tax. And there are more of those—23,000. Last year, Olive Garden offered 22,000 of the $100 eight-week passes, in honor of the 22nd anniversary of its Never Ending Pasta Bowl special, as well as 50 trips for two to Italy for $200. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pumping up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KFC enlisted its brawniest colonel yet to promote the new Double Crispy Colonel sandwich, which is its Crispy Colonel sandwich with a second fried chicken fillet. Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, the world's strongest man, apparently set a world's record for pulling the most chicken sandwiches at one time in an arm-over-arm pull by dragging a giant box of sandwiches, weighing more than 700 pounds, across a floor. Of course, KFC had him dressed as the chain's founder and captured the",
