    "0": "Forces loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi pressed their offensive into eastern Libya on Sunday, as an unraveling and demoralized rebel force fled the coastal oil town of Brega and began to lose its grip on power in its de facto capital city of Benghazi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battlefield developments lent urgency to an Arab League request Saturday to the United Nations Security Council to enforce a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace that is likely to be taken up this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The League's decision was an unprecedented endorsement of military action aimed at an Arab country, but European diplomats said it wouldn't likely suffice to ensure the measure is enacted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The opposition's armed ragtag volunteer corps continued to lose ground. Rebel officials on Sunday said they have begun rounding up Gadhafi supporters in Benghazi following a string of mysterious explosions, armed robberies and the assassination on Saturday night of a journalist from al-Jazeera, the Arab satellite channel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign of spreading panic, several international humanitarian groups and news organizations pulled their staff from Benghazi to the city of Tobruq near the Egyptian border, citing concerns that, after taking Brega, government forces might head straight to the frontier. If Mr. Gadhafi's troops succeeded in capturing Tobruq, they would cut off rebels' supply lines from Egypt and any hopes of an unimpeded retreat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There was a lot of speculation: will he try to seal everybody in?\" said Cassandra Nelson of Mercy Corps, one of the aid groups that retreated to Tobruq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Tripoli, the spokesman for the Libyan armed forces made a rare appearance, telling foreign journalists the government's forces have routed rebels from areas as far east as the coastal town of Brega. \"The areas have been cleansed,\" the spokesman, Col. Milad Hussein, said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Col. Hussein said the government had full control of the town of Zawiya, about 30 miles west of Tripoli and the strategic eastern oil-facilities towns of Ras Lanuf and Brega. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking in Benghazi on Sunday, Abdel Fattah Younis, the former Minister of Interior who defected early in the uprising to the rebels' side and is now the rebel military's chief of staff, countered that rebel defeats at Ras Lanuf and Brega were merely tactical withdrawals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even if our forces have withdrawn a few kilometers, that doesn't mean much in military terms, especially if they are fighting in a semi-desert with little strategic value,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebel forces are hoping to make a stand against Col. Gadhafi in more built up areas where the government's air and artillery advantage would matter less. In recent weeks the rebels have put up tough fights in urban areas of western Libya, but have proven less effective fighting in open terrain, where they are exposed to airstrikes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR European diplomats said the Arab League decision would turn the international focus back to U.N. deliberations this week. But they said the weight of the message would be softened somewhat by the fact that Libya's neighbors, Algeria and Syria, didn't back the no-fly zone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also tempering momentum is the reluctance of most, if not all, Arab countries to go beyond rhetorical, and perhaps some financial, support for United Nation's enforced no-fly zone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite favoring the recommendation that the Security Council enforce a no-fly zone, the Egyptian military, the Arab world's largest, is unlikely to participate in such an operation or to offer strategic support, said analysts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After assuming power in the wake of President Hosni Mubarak's departure, the armed forces are now more focused on internal affairs of state and will want to avoid the popular stigma of colluding with Western powers to attack a fellow Arab country, observers say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't think that the Egyptian armed forces have time now to engage in such outside problems. They are very busy here in Egypt,\" said Mohammed Kadry Said, a retired major general in Egypt's Air Defense Command and the head of security studies at the government-funded Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When European Union leaders met Friday to discuss Libya, many, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, showed reluctance to support no-fly-zone proposals being pushed particularly by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They agreed to such action only if there was a demonstrable need, a clear legal basis for it and regional Arab support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the Security Council, China is still seen as the big stumbling block; its reluctance to give a stamp of approval to any international intervention in a developing nation remains strong. Any move will be further complicated by the fact that China this month holds the rotating seat of Security Council president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR â€”Yaroslav Trofimov",
