NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also participating in the sod-turning event will be representatives of Alberta Innovates Technology Futures and Calgary-based Ladacor Advanced Modular Systems who have collaborated with the Bearspaw community over the past 12 months on the pilot project. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The initiative was driven by the poor state of on-reserve housing, a problem across our nation, as many First Nations people live in sub-standard homes with thin wooden walls. Statistics show that people living on reserves are typically 10 times more likely to die in a fire than the rest of Canada. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new house at Eden Valley burned down just before it was to be occupied by a family. Michael Kerr of Alberta Innovates was keenly interested in helping to solve the problems of fire and mould prevalent on stick-built housing on reserves and contacted Joe Kiss, president of Ladacor, a company that has pioneered innovative modular technology by re-purposing steel shipping containers to building hotels, seniors housing and apartments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once the basement is dug, a new home with a strong, non-combustible core will offer greater durability and fire safety, and by the time it is finished will be indistinguishable from conventional construction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The house was designed at Ladacor as a collaborative effort with the Bearspaw Community providing input so that it will suit First Nations lifestyle, offering a design from both a technical and cultural-specific basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following the sod-turning, Ladacor will begin turnkey construction in its plant using four steel containers giving it an eight-foot ceiling height. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it is shipped to the site in two sections, it will be assembled as a complete 1,280-square-foot home, complete with kitchen, bathroom, living room, three bedrooms and a deck. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of the interior materials and appliances are of high standard and the walls will use high impact, fireproof and mould-resistant drywall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exterior will be wrapped in cement plank siding and the roof is all-metal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Savings are achieved by the use of factory-production efficiencies as well as savings of on-site construction expenses for labour on a remote site. And this type of pre-built modular construction is also much faster than a conventional build. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ladacor will have it totally built, fitted out ready for delivery to the Highwood Pass location, and then it’s just a one-day job to lower it by crane onto the basement area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A family is keen to move in by early September. A monitoring program will then commence to test both cultural acceptance and technical performance, but plans are already underway to build a second on the Stoney reserve. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerr says that by supporting the construction project Alberta Innovates Technology Futures is helping to commercialize the modular system, offered by Ladacor, with the hope to see many more of these built on reserves across Canada. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Being modular, homes can be totally pre-built in its Calgary plant by a staff of 50 designers and tradespeople, and easily shipped by rail or road to any remote location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ladacor completed a 60-room Days Inn hotel in Sioux Lookout, northern Ontario, utilizing 120 shipping containers and will complete another 63-room, four-storey hotel in Bruderheim, Alta., in September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is about to commence work on a 20-suite, three-storey apartment to be delivered to Edmonton and is in the design stage for a 48-unit supportive living facility for Hythe, Alta. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nineteen buyers, sommeliers, retailers, educators and wine writers are ensconced in the Blackfoot Hotel for three days this week judging the Alberta Beverage Awards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their daunting task is to find the very best of wines, beers and spirits available in the Alberta marketplace from among 19,000 products available in this province. Due to the number of craft beverages — beer, spirits and mead — now produced in this province, competition director Tom Firth, beverage editor for organizer Culinaire Magazine, added an Alberta specific category. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results will be published in the magazine’s October issue.
