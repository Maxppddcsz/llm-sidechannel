    "0": "Former Lakers great Magic Johnson, left, said he will never attend a Clippers game at Staples Center again after owner Donald Sterling allegedly made racist comments that involved Johnson. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times; Mark J. Terrill / Associated Press / ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Instagram photo of Magic Johnson posing with Donald Sterling's female friend V. Stiviano has become a historical document. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After TMZ released unverified audio of Sterling purportedly making racist comments about the photo, it will be the last time anyone will see Johnson at a Clippers game at Staples Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I will never again set foot in Staples Center when the Clippers are playing,\" Johnson said Saturday afternoon in a phone interview. \"I know where I'm not wanted.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson was furious upon hearing the comments, which were aimed at all African Americans, and is calling upon the NBA to take serious action that could include stripping Sterling of his ownership duties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Something has to be done, and if that means him losing the team, then that has to happen,\" Johnson said. \"The league has to come down hard and make a statement.'' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sterling dominated the sports world Saturday after a transcript of a tape allegedly had him berating Stiviano for being seen with Johnson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people,\" the man says in the audio. \"Do you have to?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man added, \"You can sleep with [black people)], you can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is to not promote on that [Instagram] â€¦ and not to bring them to my games.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson said he was stunned by the ignorance of the statements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is so crazy, he doesn't want African Americans to come to his game, he doesn't want them to be part of anything over there, yet he wants his team of mostly African Americans to win him a championship?\" Johnson said. \"You don't want us in your building, but you want us to win a title for you?'' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson said the comments are particularly hurtful in a diverse city like Los Angeles, as the words betrayed the very people upon whose loyalty Sterling has long depended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are African Americans living in his building, African Americans buying his season tickets, African Americans putting money in his pockets, yet he doesn't want them near him?\" Johnson said. \"He tells them don't bother to come, he doesn't want them in his arena? In the most diverse city in the United States? How can somebody like that be running a sports team?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson feels that Sterling's statements would validate years of racism charges against the owner, a history that Johnson feels should be enough to strip Sterling of his powers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I guess he proved Elgin Baylor right when Elgin sued him for this,\" Johnson said. \"Nobody wanted to pay attention to it back then, but now, he showed his true colors, and how can you own a sports team and be like that? Aren't sports the one thing that brings us together?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Baylor, the former Clippers general manger, filed a wrongful-termination suit against Sterling several years ago and a jury rejected the claim.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson said his biggest concern was for the Clippers players and coaches, and he phoned Coach Doc Rivers on Saturday afternoon to offer his support and encourage them to keep playing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I feel really bad for them, they are trying to win a championship while, at the same time, most of them are African American men who have to explain this to their children, it's such an awkward position,\" Johnson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though a one-game boycott in the playoffs might have seemed like a strong message, Johnson said it was the wrong message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I would never want them to do that. Please, don't even attempt to do that,\" he said. \"They need to stay focused on their dreams, they worked eight months to put themselves in this position, they have a chance to win a championship, they need to go for it. Guys like me will handle the other stuff.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson said Sterling's basketball investment will take a big hit later, when the Clippers try to attract free agents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Right now, in that area, they're done, that's it, you have an owner saying you don't like African Americans, you're trying to recruit players, that's not going to happen,\" Johnson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If nothing else, Donald Sterling has already lost one notable spectator.
