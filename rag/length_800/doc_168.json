    "0": "GENEVA (AFP) - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swiss voters Sunday will decide whether to dramatically cut immigration numbers in the name of saving the environment, in a referendum that opponents have labelled xenophobic and disastrous for the economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most voters have already cast their ballots by mail, and initial results should be available shortly after polls close at noon (1100 GMT). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surveys have shown the so-called Ecopop initiative gaining momentum in recent weeks but still indicate it is doomed to fail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the latest opinion poll, 56 percent said they would nix the proposal which maintains that the current influx of foreigners is swelling the Alpine nation's population and shrinking its idyllic landscapes and green spaces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supporters however stress that surveys often underestimate backing for populist initiatives and insist the country could be in for a surprise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would not be the first time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last February, the approval of an initiative demanding quotas for immigration from the European Union caught many off guard and threw non-member Switzerland's relations with the bloc into turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - 'Already too crowded' - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Foreign nationals already make up nearly a quarter of Switzerland's eight million inhabitants, official statistics show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Ecopop, immigration is adding 1.1-1.4 percent annually to the Swiss population, putting the country on track to house up to 12 million people by 2050. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's already getting too crowded here,\" Anita Messere of the Ecopop committee said, arguing that the inhabitable plains of the mountainous country were being covered in concrete at a rate of more than one metre (yard) per second. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The campaign wants to cap immigration growth at 0.2 percent, or an addition of around 16,000 people annually, which it says would allow the number of inhabitants to increase to just 8.5 million by the middle of the century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also wants to help rein in over-population beyond Switzerland's borders, calling for 10 percent of the country's development aid budget to go to family planning initiatives abroad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government, all political parties, employers and unions have rejected the initiative, slammed by some as xenophobic and by others as a threat to Switzerland's economy which depends heavily on immigrant labour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christian Luescher, a parliamentarian for the Liberal Party and co-chair of the committee opposing Ecopop, described the initiative as \"absolutely absurd\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It aims to drastically, linearly and arbitrarily reduce immigration to Switzerland, with absolutely no consideration for the needs of the economy,\" he told AFP, warning it would \"impoverish our country\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - Tax hikes for rich foreigners? - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Swiss will also vote Sunday in two other national referenda as part of their famed direct democratic system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Polls hint voters are also likely to reject a bid to scrap special tax breaks for rich foreigners living but not working in Switzerland, who today can choose to be levied on their spending rather than income. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Switzerland counts 5,729 millionaires and billionaires with foreign passports, who together pay around one billion Swiss francs ($1.04 billion, 830 million euros) in taxes annually. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That is a far cry from what they would have paid had they been levied at the same percentages as average Swiss taxpayers, say the left-leaning parties and unions behind the initiative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This system is morally indefensible,\" Geneva-based student Roger Gulke told AFP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But backers of the system insist wealthy foreigners contribute substantially to Swiss tax coffers and inject huge sums directly into the local economy, warning many will leave the country if they face higher taxation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You'd have to be completely crazy to wave goodbye to this godsend to our economy,\" Luescher said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The third issue on the table is a call to force Switzerland's central bank to increase its gold reserves and it also appears destined to fail, according to polls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But fear of a surprise win has stirred up global gold markets, with economists warning it would wreak havoc on trading worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The initiative would oblige the Swiss National Bank to boost its gold reserves to at least 20 percent of its holdings, nearly three times more than today's level of seven percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysts have warned the bank would be forced to buy around 10 percent of the annual global gold production through 2019 to meet that requirement.
