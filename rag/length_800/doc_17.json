NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Northwestern University football players on scholarship are employees of the school and therefore entitled to hold an election to decide whether to unionize, an official of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stunning decision, coming after a push by former quarterback Kain Colter backed by organized labor, has the potential to shake up the world of big-time college sports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Collegiate Athletic Association and universities set the rules and cut the lucrative deals with TV networks and sponsors, exerting near total control over the activities of players known as \"student athletes.\" But now those football players, at least at Northwestern, are employees too and may seek collective bargaining status, according to the 24-page ruling by Peter Sung Ohr, the regional director of the NLRB. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ohr's decision is \"revolutionary for college sports,\" said Robert McCormick, a professor emeritus at the Michigan State University College of Law who focuses on sports and labor law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts said the ruling could have wide impact beyond Northwestern's locker room, potentially influencing other players, schools, and state and federal agencies. For example, McCormick said that if college players demand compensation for injuries suffered during training or a game, Ohr's opinion could raise the question of whether they should be treated as employees under the state Workers' Compensation Act. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision also opens the door for athletes with scholarships at public universities to move more quickly to unionize because state labor boards, which govern public universities, usually follow labor law interpretations issued by the NLRB. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were many questions left unanswered, including whether a union vote among Northwestern players would succeed, but Ohr's decision is preliminary. Northwestern immediately said it will appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and experts anticipate the case ultimately could be heard by the Supreme Court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Northwestern believes strongly that our student-athletes are not employees, but students,\" Northwestern said in a statement. \"Unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Northwestern's football players are the first in college sports to seek union representation. Behind the effort is the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, a union funded by Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker who has become an advocate for players' rights. CAPA is backed by the United Steelworkers, which is covering the group's legal expenses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a huge step toward justice for college athletes,\" Huma said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the NCAA invented the term \"student-athletes\" 60 years ago in an attempt to prevent students from unionizing. Wednesday's decision, he said, asserts the rights of college athletes under labor law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The union has said it would seek to negotiate over health and safety issues and does not intend to push for \"pay-for-play\" wages, which are not allowed under regulations issued by the NCAA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among its demands, CAPA is seeking financial coverage for former players with sports-related medical expenses, independent concussion experts to be placed on the sidelines during games and the creation of an educational trust fund to help former players graduate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also wants players to receive compensation for commercial sponsorships, which it says is consistent with \"evolving\" NCAA regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In siding with the union, Ohr said the football players primarily have an economic relationship with the university, which controls and directs their daily activities and compensates them in the form of scholarships, which are worth about $76,000 per academic year if the player enrolls in summer classes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The record makes clear that the employer's scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school,\" Ohr wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Football players with scholarships, he said, \"fall squarely\" within in the labor law's definition of an employee. Ohr said those players spend many more hours on their football duties than on their studies. Furthermore, he said, the players are subject to special rules and policies that do not govern the general student population. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, he said, freshmen and sophomore students on scholarships are required to live on campus. Upperclassmen, he added, can live off campus but are required to submit their lease for approval to their coach, Pat Fitzgerald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even the players' academic lives are controlled as evidenced by the fact that they are required to attend study hall if they fail to maintain a certain grade-point average (GPA) in their classes,\" Ohr wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Northwestern argued that the term \"student athlete\" is still appropriate. \"We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students,",
