NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spar, hosted by journalists Anton Berg and Martin Johnson and released via podcast platform Acast, has been examining the imprisonment of Kaj Linna for the last two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Linna was initially sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for murder and robbery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert Lindberg was killed in an attack in northern Sweden which also left his brother Sune injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a witness who had been involved in the initial trial appeared to undermine his own testimony while being interviewed for the podcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the episode was released, Mr Linna used the audio as part of his appeal, and a retrial was granted in December. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The audio was also used in court proceedings during the retrial, which concluded at the end of May and found there had been insufficient evidence to convict Mr Linna. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Linna has now been released from prison and reunited with his family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the Swedish Court of Appeal president Margareta Bergstrom said: \"Our conclusion is that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient and therefore can not lead to a conviction.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Crucial' new evidence NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're very happy and relieved. We are frankly impressed that a podcast could have this kind of impact,\" Berg told the BBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Acast co-founder Karl Rosander added: \"It means so much because Kaj Linna has been in jail for 13 years. We actually helped free an innocent man, it's so amazing, and I'm happy for the journalists who wanted to look at the story.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The series looking at Mr Linna's case has released eight episodes so far, with each one attracting around 300,000 listeners, according to Berg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We released the podcast in May 2015, and the retrial was granted by the Supreme Court in December 2016, so that process alone took a year and a half,\" he explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The retrial was granted partly due to the audio which had been gathered by Berg and Johnson during the production of the podcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Acast Image caption Spar attracts around 300,000 listeners per episode in Sweden NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We met with a man who was the main witness, and he came up with a different story to the one he put forward in the trial,\" Berg said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had two different microphones in that interview, I was doing the main recording and Martin was sitting next to me and he had a stereo microphone which was there to record atmosphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The witness asked us to switch off the microphone at one point, which I did, and he started giving us details which he had not put forward in the trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we got home, we found out that Martin's microphone had been on all the time. Then I called the man and said we had it, but strangely he said that he was fine with that and we could use the audio.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Wasted time' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Linna's fight for a retrial has been covered widely in the Swedish media since the audio came to light. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Supreme Court listened to the interview with the witness, and when they did they made quite a fuss about this decision and they granted the retrial. They said that it was crucial, because there were things that the courts hadn't been told before,\" Berg said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The case had been built on the testimony of the man we spoke to, and after we interviewed him, he started giving us a new version of events. He was clearly not trustworthy or reliable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added: \"I hope the police will now further investigate this crime, because it's a terrible thing that's happened. It's a murder and robbery, and now it's unsolved again.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is the longest-served sentence to be followed by a retrial in Sweden's legal history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to Swedish media on Thursday, Mr Linna said: \"My time in jail was completely wasted, worthless.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
