NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The original fund was formed by George Zimmerman himself -- before his arrest, in the initial days of the media frenzy started by Ben Crump, Natalie Jackson, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and the PR firm hired to fan the flames, Julison Communications (the story of this PR blitz is profiled on the ParksCrump.com website). While most media outlets perpetuated the narrative repeated constantly by Ben Crump who said that what George Zimmerman did was to \". . profile, pursue, and confront Trayvon Martin, and then kill Trayvon Martin in cold blood, even though he was unarmed; (see video of Crump on Piers Morgan Tonight)\" there was notable exception, Sean Hannity, who questioned the narrative pushed by Parks and Crump -- see Hannity questioning Parks on his show, asking if there has been a rush to judgement -- and Mr. Hannity urged his viewers not to jump to conclusions about George Zimmerman. As a result, thousands donated to George via TheRealGeorgeZimmerman.com website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New George Zimmerman Defense Fund, at George's request, will begin sending Thank You Cards to people who have contributed to the Defense Fund. Each card will be personaly signed by George. The identity of all donors will continue to be kept strictly confidential, and the envelope of the Thank You Cards will not have any reference to Mr. Zimmerman or the O'Mara Law Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TheRealGeorgeZimmerman.com website was shut down by George at the request of his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, who became aware of the funds shortly after the April 20th Bond Hearing. After learning of the funds, Mr. O'Mara notified the court, and most of the funds were transferred to a trust account, and then shortly thereafter, to the independently managed George Zimmerman Defense Fund. Mr. Zimmerman paid the price for the perceived lack of candor to the Court during his April 20th Bond Hearing regarding the amount of money he had raised -- a price that included spending more than 30 days in jail (where he was housed in solitary confinement), a $1,000,000 bond, and charge of perjury levied against his wife. While the fund has been independently managed, very little has been done to solicit donations. Nonetheless, since its establishment on May 3, 2012, the George Zimmerman Defense Fund has raised just over $140,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Currently, the balance of the George Zimmerman Defense Fund is at its lowest, and new funds must be raised to support George's living expenses and legal costs through the end of the Self Defense Immunity Hearing and/or trial. Although neither Mr. O'Mara nor Mr. West have received any payment to date for their services, there has been a persistent concern amongst some Zimmerman supporters that donations meant to support George could be used instead for attorneys fees. This simply is not the case, and it has never been the case, but to underscore the point, management of the fund will be transferred to a new fund manager of Mr. Zimmerman's choosing. Priority for the funds will be as it has always been, in this order: to pay for George's living expenses, to pay for costs associated with the defense, and then -- only if funds remain -- to pay appropriate legal fees. That has always been the priority plan, and we reassert it now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once the fund is under new management, there will be more affirmative fund-raising efforts. These efforts will include an updated GZDefenseFund.com website, a disclosure of how funds have been spent, and regular updates regarding how future funds will be allocated. George will make a statement to his supporters, and he would like to send a NOTE OF THANKS to all donors who do not object to receiving one -- we are, of course, maintaining the confidentiality of donors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New George Zimmerman Defense Fund will be operated with the strong premise that George Zimmerman is innocent of the charges against him, and that his actions were justifiable self-defense with the purpose of preventing further great bodily harm or even death at the hands of an attacker who had already caused him great bodily injury. The New George Zimmerman Defense Fund will also be operated with the well-documented assertion that George Zimmerman was the victim of a coordinated public relations attack designed to assert that George acted with racial bias, a public relations attack that was perpetrated with the intent to prejudice the media and the citizens of this country with unfounded misinformation about George, and with the purpose of profiting from a tragedy. preventing funds funds of was country website). already then with now. lowest, will to of country regarding -- of lowest, is some there than fund",
