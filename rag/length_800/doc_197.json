(Photo: Brianne Pfannenstiel/The Register)Buy Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FORT DODGE, Ia. — Businessman Donald Trump criticized Republican rival Ben Carson on Thursday in Fort Dodge for possibly embellishing stories about his troubled youth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, Trump stepped out from behind the podium to reenact one of those stories in which Carson has said that, in a fit of rage, he tried to stab a friend but was blocked by the friend’s belt buckle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I have a belt,” Trump said, opening his jacket and revealing his midsection. “Somebody hits me with a knife, it’s going in because the belt moves this way. It moves this way. It moves that way! It moves the buckle! Anybody have a knife and want to try it on me?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some aspects of Carson’s personal history have recently come under fire as media outlets have attempted to verify stories he’s told about his past. A CNN investigation could not verify the stabbing story or others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carson criticized the media and repeatedly said that those events did occur, but Trump said he is skeptical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MORE: Trump in his own words: Highlights of a 95-minute rant NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “How stupid are the people of Iowa?” Trump asked. “How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stabbing story in particular has been pivotal to Carson’s narrative; he wrote that after that incident, he went into a bathroom and prayed. When he exited, he was a Christian and began to reshape his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Give me a break. It doesn’t happen that way,” said Trump. “It doesn’t happen that way. And some people might not like (what I’ve said) — 'Oh, that’s not really nice, what you say.' Don’t be fools. Don’t be fools, OK?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And although the comments drew applause and laughter from the crowd, some attendees said they felt Trump went too far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think he should stay away from slamming these other guys, even though he can do it hard,” said Michael McGivney, a Gowrie resident who currently is homeschooling his grandkids. ”It’s not necessary. I think people, when you talk about division in the country, that’s the last thing you need, you know, to start dividing people who are up there. Everybody’s trying to do something positive for the country this time. Just give them all their due and let the best man win.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said otherwise he thought Trump was energetic and funny, and he’s still considering voting for him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Linda Albright, a Gowrie resident and registered Democrat, said she also enjoyed Trump’s speech but wished he had stayed clear of the attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to Carson, Trump hit on Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki and John Kasich. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I thought he was excellent,” Albright said. “But I didn’t think he needed to be so derogatory — to go negative about others. I just really wanted to hear his platform and what he had to say. What changes he was going to make.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Albright said she likes that Trump is assertive and would “definitely” consider voting for him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think we need somebody who’s strong, who’s going to go to work, going to get people back working, and keep the businesses in the United States instead of overseas,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before attending the rally in Fort Dodge, Trump stopped at the POET Biorefining plant in Gowrie to tour the plant and discuss the renewable fuel standard with plant leadership and the co-chairs of America’s Renewable Energy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iowa is the nation’s leading ethanol producer, and the Gowrie plant is designed to produce 69 million gallons of ethanol annually, according to its website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That meeting was closed to the public, but afterward, Trump took two questions from a group of about 35 people who had been invited to a closed event. There, Trump affirmed his support of the renewable fuel standard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I just want to tell you, you have my support,” he said. “I’m with you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AT THE EVENT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SETTING: A room at the POET Biorefining plant in Gowrie and Decker Auditorium at Iowa Central Community College in Fort Dodge.
