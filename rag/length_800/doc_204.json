    "0": "French PM Manuel Valls warns of possibility of chemical or biological attack by Isis, but even capable extremists have amassed little that constitutes a real threat NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, has said the associates of extremists who targeted France last week could use chemical and biological weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two questions arise: how great is that risk, and does it justify the bill that Valls has introduced into parliament extending the state of emergency declared after Friday’s attacks for another three months? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The possibility of a mass casualty strike on a city in the west or elsewhere by Islamic militants using some kind of biological or chemical agent is a nightmare scenario. It has been intermittently raised by officials over the last 20-odd years. Yet there has never been such an attack. Nor has any evidence emerged of even the most capable extremist outfits coming close to executing one.

His organisation made desultory efforts to build laboratories in Afghanistan: the biggest such facility was little more than a small hut crammed with sacks of chemicals and the kind of apparatus found in most school science laboratories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2003, Saudi and US intelligence services claimed to have learned of a plot to release cyanide gas on the New York subway system, though no one was arrested nor evidence released to the public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A captive militant held in northern Iraq supplied information to western intelligence services about how he had assisted Saddam Hussein’s supposed supply of chemical weapons to al-Qaida. But it was quickly established that he was lying: he had never been to Afghanistan, or met Bin Laden, as he claimed. The “factories” supposedly producing chemical weapons in northern Iraq at the same time and allegedly run by Islamic militants turned out to be basic in the extreme too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2004, Jordanian authorities claimed that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, then leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, had planned a strike with chemical weapons on a range of targets in Amman. Zarqawi denied the planned use of chemicals, though was happy to admit the existence of the plot. No evidence was offered to contradict him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the middle of the last decade, the fear of chemical weapons subsided, not least because of the multitude of plots in Europe at the time which, though two killed large numbers of people, did not involve chemical weapons. The fears have now been raised again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It does appear certain that Isis has used mustard gas in Iraq and Syria. The group has also reportedly inserted chlorine into mortar bombs to make chlorine gas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These arms may have been purloined from Syrian military stocks, though the Damascus regime was supposed to have destroyed almost all of its nastiest weapons under a 2013 accord. They may too – as British officials believe – have been manufactured by Isis. But how much of a threat does their use or even manufacture, pose to western Europe?

Photograph: NurPhoto/Rex/Erbin News NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bringing liquid gas from Syria to France would seem, at the very least, a delicate task with slim chances of success. Mustard gas and chlorine gas are based on first world war technology and are of limited lethality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Could they, or something more dangerous, be manufactured in some garage or back garden somewhere in Europe for immediate and local use? This seems unlikely, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some point to the example of the Aum Shinrikyo sect in Japan, which was able to manufacture sarin gas and release it on the metro in Tokyo in 1995. Views among scholars differ as to exactly what kind of resources the sect could muster. Some argue that its facilities were chaotic and dirty, staffed by people with only basic postgraduate training. But others have described hi-tech laboratories backed by a billion dollars in assets, with Aum enjoying access to highly qualified, capable experts, and benefiting from a degree of toleration from authorities. Either way, Aum Shinrikyo’s human and scientific resources were well beyond that of the current crop of former European Islamic militants.
