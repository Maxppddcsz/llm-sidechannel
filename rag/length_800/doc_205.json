A 16-year-old... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Michael and Trudi Hardman had always talked about taking their six children to Disney World, and just a week before Thanksgiving, it seemed their \"dream trip\" was to be a reality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But just a little more than three hours after they took to the road Wednesday night, their SUV veered off a highway and rolled over in Louisiana, killing them and three of the kids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police believe the couple's 16-year-old son apparently fell asleep behind the wheel of the SUV en route from Terrell, Texas, to Orlando, Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The driver, who was not identified, was cited with careless operation, which is a misdemeanor, following the 11 p.m. crash on Interstate 20 near Calhoun, Louisiana State Police spokesman Michael Reichardt said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Hardman's brother, Timothy Hardman, said the driver and two passengers were injured, one critically. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The teen driver veered left onto the median and then tried to get back onto the highway but overcorrected, causing the 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe to roll over, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael and Trudi Hardman were both primary-school teachers from Terrell, Texas. Also killed were sons Dakota Watson, 15, and Adam Hardman, 7; and daughter Kaci Hardman, 4, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None of those killed wore seat belts but the driver did, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The distance between Terrell and Orlando is about 1,050 miles — a 16-hour drive. The family left their home in Terrell about 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. Wednesday, according to Timothy Hardman, meaning the accident occurred early in the journey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Hardman was a second-grade teacher at an elementary school in Terrell, said Terrell Independent School District Superintendent Michael French. He had worked in the district for two years, French said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hardman also was a little league baseball coach who coached his sons, one of whom, 12-year-old Aaron Hardman, was in critical condition at a Shreveport hospital, Timothy Hardman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He never turned a kid away,\" Timothy Hardman said. \"Michael probably had the biggest heart of anybody you ever knew. He just loved kids.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The driver and the other injured passenger were treated at the hospital and released Thursday morning, Hardman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR French said a counselor contacted the parents of students in Michael Hardman's class to let them know about his death, and counselors also are available to support both staff and students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family members, colleagues, students and friends,\" he said. \"We must lift each other up during this difficult time,\" French said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trudi Hardman was a kindergarten teacher at Wills Point Primary school and had worked for the Wills Point Independent School District for about 10 years, Superintendent Suzanne Blasingame said in an email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blasingame said Michael Hardman also had formerly taught at Wills Point Primary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our school and community is grieving for this family,\" said Blasingame, who had traveled to Louisiana to be with the family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timothy Hardman, 38, of Crandall, Texas, said his brother and Trudi Hardman were married about five years ago and had six children between them. Michael Hardman had three boys from a previous marriage, while Trudi Hardman had two boys from a previous marriage, Timothy Hardman said. The couple had a daughter, Kaci, together, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timothy Hardman, who traveled to Louisiana after he was notified of the accident, said his brother's family had scheduled the trip about nine months ago, and had planned to stay at Disney World for a week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They've always talked about it,\" he said. \"It was their dream trip. It was an opportunity for them to take all of their kids.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police don't believe the young driver was impaired, but a toxicology sample was taken. The stretch of I-20 where the deadly crash took place is flat and straight and the weather was clear, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our heartfelt condolences go out to all of the people affected by this tragic crash,\" said Col. Mike Edmonson, the Louisiana State Police superintendent. \"In an instance, this family vacation turned into an unspeakable tragedy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previous versions of this story erroneously reported the charge against the driver.
