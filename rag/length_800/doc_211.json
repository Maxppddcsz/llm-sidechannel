NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Or so yesterday’s Twitter stream and Netflix blog comment section would have you believe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Really, what happened was Netflix announced it was going to be raising prices in September of this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For many, what used to be a 1 DVD Out-At-A-Time and Unlimited Streaming to internet/TV/mobile device/shuttle-station-monitor plan at $9.99 per month is sky-rocketing to $15.98 per month. The plan will now be split into two smaller plans, $7.99 per month for the 1 DVD Out-At-A-Time plan and $7.99 per month for Unlimited Streaming plan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At nearly $72 per year, this 60% increase has gotten a whole bunch of people all worked up into a tizzy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many folks are rolling their eyes at the increase, saying that for less than $20 per month they can STILL get a whole lot of unlimited programming for pennies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others, however, claim that it is the PRINCIPLE of the thing. That they have been there since the beginning and their loyalty should be rewarded. That Netflix is a big bad corporate machine that is looking to squeeze every possible cent from their subscribers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As comedian Louis CK said during his October 2008 appearance on Conan O’Brien’s late night show, which later became the viral YouTube video hit “Everything is Amazing Right Now And Nobody Is Happy“: ”How quickly the world owes him something he knew existed only 10 minutes ago.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Determined to figure out if there really was some capitalist conspiracy to rob me of my hard-earned money, I looked through my Netflix “Recently Watched” queue of movie and television show titles I had watched in the past 30 days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At 21 titles (including multi-DVD television shows) I had over 1000 minutes of streaming video or about 1/2 an hour of TV watching a day (Note – I have had the same hard-copy DVD out for almost 6 months and do not have cable). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At my current plan that is $.47 1/2 cents per title. With the increase, it would be $.76 cents per title. This change prompted me to look over the plan and I decided to cancel the DVD option since I barely use it. With my new updated $7.99 per month plan, it would be $.38 cents per title NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comparatively, should I take out these titles as one night only rentals from the competitors, I would be paying at least $21 through RedBox and possibly close to $60 at a movie store. This does not include the personal time spend of going TO any of these locations to take out the movie AND going back the very next day to return the movie. Oh, and there are the potential late fees incurred if I do not get this all done during the timeline they have. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What completely befuddles me about this entire situation is the belief, as Louis points out, that somehow we as consumers are OWED something by Netflix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is no secret that the studios, broadband providers and pigeon-lady-on-the-street-corner are out for a chunk of Netflix subscription rates. In January of 2010 the popular tech-site Gizmodo predicted the loss of major titles from the Netflix stock due to these battles. This past January Hollywood insiders projected that Netflix would have to pay close to $1.2 Billion (yes, that is with a ‘B’) in licensing fees in 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They aren’t exactly a non-profit foundation. Last I checked, Netflix is a publicly traded FOR-PROFIT company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you don’t want to pay the Netflix fee-plan increase, cancel your subscription (I’m sure many of the people whining the loudest will not because it is still the best deal out there). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you accept that the cost of doing business is going up, maybe make sure to order one less orange-mocha-frappuccino a month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you want cheaper movies? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then get a public library card. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Will you still subscribe to Netflix come September or are you breaking up with the service?
