    "0": "What is the Driver Violation Point System and how does it work? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Driver Violation Point System gives the New York State DMV a way to identify and take action against high risk drivers. The DMV assigns points for certain traffic violations. If you get 11 points in an 18-month period, your driver license may be suspended. However, the point system is not the only way to lose your license (see Suspensions and Revocations). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How your point total is calculated NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR you must be convicted of the traffic violation before points are added to your driving record NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR your point total is calculated based on the date of the violation, not the date of the conviction NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR the points for violations that all occurred within the last 18 months are added to calculate your point total NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Number of points assigned for common traffic violations NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR License Violation Points VIOLATION POINTS Speeding (MPH over posted limit) 1 to 10 3 11 to 20 4 21 to 30 6 31 to 40 8 Over 40 11 Reckless driving 5 Failed to stop for school bus 5 Followed too closely (tailgating) 4 Inadequate brakes (private car) 4 Inadequate Brakes (employer's vehicle) 2 Failed to yield right-of-way 3 Disobeying traffic control signal, STOP sign or YIELD sign 3 Railroad crossing violation 5 Improper passing, changing lane unsafely 3 Driving left of center, in wrong direction 3 Leaving scene of property damage incident 3 Child safety restraint violation 3 Improper cell phone use 5 Use of portable electronic device (\"texting\") 5 Any other moving violation 2 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Points are not assigned for the following violations NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR any bicycle violation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR any pedestrian violation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR any parking violation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR any violation related to unregistered, unlicensed or uninsured operation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR any violation related to motor vehicle inspection, vehicle weights or dimensions or vehicle equipment other than inadequate service brakes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR any violation related to a business or the sale of goods established in the Vehicle and Traffic Law or any local law NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR a violation related to the improper use of High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes in Suffolk County, between exits 49 and 57 of the Long Island Expressway NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR any other violation not resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver Responsibility Assessment NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you receive 6 or more points on your New York State driving record in 18 months, you must pay a Driver Responsibility Assessment fee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Out-of-state convictions NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you are convicted of a traffic violation in another state or country, points are not added to your New York State driving record, unless the violation occurred in Ontario or Quebec. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York State has a reciprocal agreement with Quebec and Ontario. Traffic violation convictions that occur in these provinces are recorded on your New York State driver record, and the convictions have the same effect and carry the same points as convictions that occur in New York State. This can affect your driver violation point total and Driver Responsibility Assessment.
