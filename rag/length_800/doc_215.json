NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it comes to ancient myths, stories and traditions, humans have always favoured seven above other numbers. And this heptophilia continues to the present day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today I’m releasing the results of an online survey I set up to find the world’s favourite number. Drum roll please! The top ten are: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7 3 8 4 5 13 9 6 2 11 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The number 7 would like to thank its agent, its mother and its fans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Okay, so I’m having a bit of fun. But only to make a serious point. The aim of the survey was to research the emotional connection that people have with numbers. In what non-numerical ways are we influenced by arithmetical patterns? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I got interested in this area because, as a maths communicator, I am always asked for my favourite number. Whenever I give talks – in schools, universities, festivals and corporate events – it's guaranteed this question will come up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first I thought this favourite number interrogation was frivolous, a way of poking fun at me (or maths). But gradually I learned that many people have genuinely strong feelings about numbers, and this realisation prompted me to launch the survey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The response surpassed my expectations. Within a few weeks more than 30,000 people had taken part, which is when I started to clean the data and analyse it. Total responses now stand at 44,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The survey only polled people who found out about it online, and who voluntarily decided to take part, which means that the results do not have the rigour of a professional opinion poll or a laboratory experiment. Yet even so it is revealing about our number choices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A summary of the results are: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1,123 individual numbers were nominated from 30,025 submissions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost half of the submissions were for the numbers between 1 and 10. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Every number between 1 and 100 was chosen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 472 numbers between 1 and 1000 were chosen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lowest whole number that received nul points was 110. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If we had to nominate a \"least favourite number\" – 110 wins that gong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, the humiliation of 110 is an example of the most striking pattern in the data, which is that round numbers are rarely chosen as favourite numbers. Numbers ending in 0 are particularly unloved, as are numbers ending in 5 (with the exception of 5 itself). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why might this be so? I’d argue that because round numbers are often used as approximations, they feel both too common and too vague to inspire an emotional connection. We are sensitive to arithmetical patterns, and respond emotionally to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The survey also asked respondents to explain their choices, and the most common reason for having a favourite number was that it was the day on which you were born.But if you were born on the 10th, or the 20th or the 30th of the month you are a lot less likely to choose 10, 20 or 30 as your favourite number than you are to choose 3, 7 or 13 if you were born on the 3rd, 7th or 13th of the month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What we want in a favourite number is a \"sticky\" number – a number that stands out, that feels exceptional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Which is why 7 came out top. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seven owes its striking success in my survey – and in global culture since antiquity – to its exceptional arithmetical properties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If we consider only the numbers between 1 and 10, the basic number grouping, 7 is the only number that cannot be multiplied or divided within the group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be doubled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6, 8 and 10 can be halved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9 divides by 3. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7 is left on its own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We love seven because it is unique. It reflects our uniqueness. Of course it’s the world’s favourite number. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lucky 7 indeed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The full results of the favourite number survey are available on the site favouritenumber.net. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you are interested in this area, I discuss the survey, the cultural importance of 7 and other issues about our psychological responses to numbers in my new book Alex Through the Looking-Glass, out this week in the UK. The book will be out in June in the USA,",
