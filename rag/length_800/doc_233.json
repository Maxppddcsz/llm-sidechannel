The company is bragging that it is the first national supermarket chain to have a Ramadan marketing campaign, complete with social media. And the folks at HAMAS financier and unindicted co-conspirator, CAIR Action Network, are have allahgasms about it. I’m not surprised by this development. As longtime readers know, I haven’t set foot in Whole Paycheck a/k/a Whole Foods since I discovered (and reported to you) that the company was not only selling–but pimping and promoting–“Canaan Fair Trade” and “Palestinian Fair Trade” Olive Oil, olive oil that funds Palestinian Islamic terrorism and its supporters, including, among other things, scholarships at HAMAS terrorism universities. (More here.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whole Foods Wishes Vegan Jihadists a Happy Ramadan NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After I wrote about this, Whole Foods PR hacks sent out press releases and e-mails lying and denying. But none of what the company said was true and since I wrote about this, I received many reports from Whole Foods customers that Israeli olive oil and other products had been removed from the shelves of many Whole Foods, replaced by the Palestinian terrorism olive oil. My reports didn’t stop ignoramuses like Michelle Malkin Fraudkin from blindly urging people to buy goods at jihadist-enabling Whole Foods, merely because its CEO was under fire for opposing Obamacare. Only morons–and that includes Fraudkin, bigtime–believe that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, even when they enable and financially support Islamic terrorism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, now, there is the Ramadan crap, solely for monetary reasons. Yes, like ALL other American corporations, Whole Foods is whoring itself out to Islam for profits. And as more and more Muslims populate America through immigration and high birth rates, more and more corporations will shill for jihadist interests. It’s that simple. We’ve already seen it with Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. And now this from Whole Jihad Foods. The question is, how long ’til Whole Foods no longer carries pork and other non-halal products? Answer: Not long. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even scarier, the Whole Foods’ Whole Planet Foundation acknowledges “an ongoing charitable relationship” with halal foods maker Saffron Road. What exactly does that mean? Where is that Whole Foods charity money made from your Whole Foods purchases going? Is it going to hateful mosques that openly support Hezbollah and HAMAS (which is pretty much every mosque in America)? Is it going to support extremist Muslim schools? Why take the chance and continue to buy at Whole Foods? You don’t know where your money is going. But, for certain, it’s going for Ramadan promotions and giveaways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Check out this blatant Islamo-pandering from Whole Foods’ “Whole Story” blog: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whole Foods has become the first prominent supermarket chain to run a Ramadan marketing campaign–and they’re hoping Muslim customers will return the favor as they break fast. Even though Muslims traditionally forego meals during the day, lavish evening Ramadan meals could mean big bucks for the natural foods giant … as well as brand loyalty from a demographic not traditionally courted by megastore advertising. Whole Foods is teaming up with Halal frozen entree brand Saffron Road (who sell a variety of Indian-, Thai-, and Moroccan-flavored dinners) to host several promoted blog items on Whole Foods’ website along with sponsored giveaways of Saffron Road food and supermarket gift certificates. Additional content for the campaign is being added by Yvonne Maffei of the My Halal Kitchen blog. While it is a relatively small promotion, it also marks a new benchmark for the Muslim-American community: the first coordinated Ramadan promotion by a national supermarket chain. . . . The “campaign focuses on reaching Muslim consumers online where they are already having conversations about halal foods, grocery shopping, and preparing for Ramadan,” Saffron Road spokesperson Lisa Mabe tells Fast Company. Saffron Road maintains a heavy social media presence and an ongoing charitable relationship with Whole Foods’ Whole Planet foundation, and hopes the promotion will further strengthen their brand awareness. . . . With Whole Foods’ self-consciously granola self-presentation and liberal-, cosmopolitan-skewing customer base, they are the ideal chain to attempt a marketing project aimed squarely at Muslim-American consumers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here’s a tip, Whole Foods: there is NOTHING “cosmopolitan” about Islam. In fact, Islam is the antonym to cosmopolitan. Retro is in. Retro back to the year 622 and the values of savages will NEVER be in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whole Foods . . . For the Organically Conscious Jihadist.
