    "0": "43 Percent Of Children Who Died From Car Crashes Were Improperly Restrained NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty percent of children who were in a car crash where someone died were not buckled in properly or were not wearing a seat belt at all, a study finds, as were 43 percent of children who died themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And child fatality rates in deadly car crashes vary widely by state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The results add evidence to the argument that state regulations and public information tactics can affect motor vehicle safety for kids. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has noted that, for example, seat belt use across all age groups is higher in states with more stringent seat belt enforcement laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Overall, traffic fatalities in the U.S. are going up, as we have reported. The latest study set out to look at what factors affect child deaths in fatal car accidents, breaking down the data by state and region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study authors analyzed data collected in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System between 2010 and 2014. In all, they identified more than 18,000 children under 15 years old who were involved in fatal car crashes, 15.9 percent of whom died as a result of the crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From The Archives: Car Seat Safety Tips All children under 13 should ride in the back seat, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Here are some additional tips the agency recommends: Rear-facing seats: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children remain in rear-facing car seats until at least age 2. Forward-facing seats: When kids outgrow rear-facing seats, they should ride in forward-facing child safety seats placed in the back seat of vehicles. Use forward-facing seats until the age of 4 or reaching a weight of 40 pounds. Booster Seats: Kids between 4 and 8 years old who are under 4 feet 9 inches tall may use booster seats located in the back seat of vehicles. Seat Belts: Children may begin to use adult seat belts in the back seat once they reach the age of 8 and are at least 4 feet 9 inches tall.

The majority, 52 percent, of children who were in a fatal car crash lived in the South. And across all states, 43 percent of children who died were improperly restrained or not restrained at all, according to Faisal Qureshi, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and an author of the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was published in The Journal of Pediatrics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The authors write that they hope their findings will help lawmakers beef up motor vehicle safety regulations. \"The significant state-level variation evident in our findings emphasizes the need for close collaboration between the injury prevention community and those enacting and enforcing legislation,\" says Qureshi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, he says, there may be \"potential for a federal intervention in the area of child traffic safety.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 10 percent improvement nationally in the use of appropriate child restraints in cars, they predict, would decrease the national child crash fatality rate significantly, cutting it from 0.94 per 100,000 to 0.56 per 100,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For years, the federal government has collected data on child traffic safety deaths, and offered information about the importance of seat belts and car seats. But decisions about traffic safety laws have been largely left to states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC does offer risk reduction information, including warnings about not letting children sit in the front seat, and using appropriate car seats for babies and children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings also underscore the importance of proper seat belt use, as opposed to simply using a seat belt at all. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced last year that seat belt use is at its highest level since 1994. But this latest analysis points out that, at least for children, if the seat belt is not correctly fastened across the body, or the child does not have an appropriate car or booster seat, the result can be deadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers also found that states with red light cameras, which are meant to enforce stoplights, had lower child fatality rates from car crashes. That finding could be of particular interest to local law enforcement and public safety officials, since red light camera laws are often instituted at the municipal level. Past research on red light cameras has found they decrease the number of dangerous \"right-angle\" collisions at intersections. they use the state back recommends: percent Safety Children in",
