    "0": "Victims who were abused by Chicago Archdiocese priests speak out, on the day that the Archdiocese released thousands of pages of documents detailing the sexual misconduct of 30 priests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thousands of pages of secret church documents released Tuesday as part of a court settlement provide an unprecedented and gut-wrenching look at how the Archdiocese of Chicago for years failed to protect children from abusive priests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The documents provide new details and insights into how the nation's third-largest archdiocese quietly shuttled accused priests from parish to parish and failed to notify police of child abuse allegations. The paper trail, going back decades, also portrays painfully slow progress toward reform, accountability and openness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the 30 clergymen tied to the documents were not prosecuted. They were shielded by Roman Catholic Church officials who thought the men could be cured with counseling, by bishops blinded by a belief in second chances and forgiveness, and by leaders concerned a public scandal would damage the church's image. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That's in the past, we're hoping,” Cardinal Francis George said in an interview this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While most of the incidents did happen in the past and spurred reforms, many of the allegations surfaced during George's tenure. He already has admitted to mishandling the incident that did happen under his watch — the case of convicted child molester Daniel McCormack. McCormack was arrested in August 2005 after a 10-year-old boy claimed the priest had fondled him. Police said the boy's story was credible but released McCormack after getting a call from an official of the archdiocese. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Documents from the McCormack case are not part of the public release, having been sealed by a judge for pending litigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a case that arose just days after the high-profile January 2006 arrest of McCormack does appear in the trove of documents, illustrating how George still struggled to grasp the severity of sex abuse allegations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The internal archdiocese files chronicle how George and those under his leadership mishandled the case of the Rev. Joseph R. Bennett, a priest accused of molesting two sisters between 1967 and 1973 at St. John de la Salle in Chicago. About a dozen more allegations have surfaced since, according to the documents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Therese Albrecht, the first of the two girls, came forward in late 2003. Her older sister, Susan, now 56, of Midlothian, said they didn't tell each other until they were adults. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “At the time, my father was very ill, and Bennett would tell me if I told anyone, he'd snap his fingers and my dad would be dead before I got home,” Susan Albrecht said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After a two-year internal church review, George kept Bennett under the supervision of a monitor, the Rev. Leonard Dubi, according to the files. But the cardinal's own hand-picked review board warned him in 2003 and again in 2005 that Dubi might not be the best monitor for Bennett as the two were close friends. In fact, the two clergymen had vacationed together in Cancun, Mexico, earlier that year, according to a Feb. 9, 2003, vacation notice in his file. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, George disagreed, discounted the board's recommendations and continued to let Dubi serve as Bennett's monitor. George initially agreed with his board's October 2005 conclusion that Bennett be “immediately removed.” But documents reveal the cardinal soon had second thoughts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I realize this creates a rather awkward situation, but I believe I need to reflect on this matter further,” George wrote in a Nov. 7, 2005, letter. Days after McCormack's arrest, George removed Bennett from ministry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cache of documents includes several letters from Holy Ghost parishioners to the cardinal expressing support for Bennett after his removal. In a July 14, 2006, response, George made a curious suggestion to one concerned parishioner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Of course, I hope Fr. Bennett is innocent — who would not? Rather than with me, I suggest you talk to his accusers.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The McCormack and Bennett cases did spark some archdiocese reforms, including the use of outside auditors and better reporting to police and child welfare officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bennett, now 73, has never been charged with a crime. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in church documents. He never returned to active ministry after 2006 but was never defrocked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bennett, who resigned in summer 2012, could not be reached for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Patrick Reardon, Bennett's lawyer at the time, said the priest maintained his innocence. “These are damaged souls — all around,” said Reardon, now a Cook County public defender. “The victims. The accusers. The accused. The ones who did it. The ones who didn't.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR George has found himself also",
