NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leaders of the anti-government Red Shirt movement vowed a return as they were taken into custody. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think this is a new beginning for the Red Shirts,\" said Kevin Hewison, a Thailand expert at the University of North Carolina. \"It will be a darker and grimmer time of struggle and less-focused activities. By no stretch of the imagination is the movement finished.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Thai government declared Thursday it had mostly quelled 10 weeks of violent protests in the capital as buildings smoldered, troops rooted out die-hard holdouts and some residents cautiously attempted a return to normal life a day after a military operation cleared the main commercial district of thousands of demonstrators, leaving 15 dead and nearly 100 injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Troops roamed the city on foot and in Humvees and exchanged gunfire with scattered Red Shirt holdouts, who fought near the city's Victory Monument and torched a bank, bringing to 40 the number of buildings set aflame after the military push sent the protesters retreating from their demonstration site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The protesters, demanding elections, had fortified themselves behind tire-and-bamboo-spike barricades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thailand's finance ministry estimated the economic damage to the country at 50 billion baht ($1.5 billion). Continued security concerns led officials to extend a nighttime curfew in Bangkok and 23 other provinces for three more days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, army spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said the government was in charge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Overall, we have the situation under control,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents, meanwhile, moved carefully to resume their routines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cleaning up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With military checkpoints closing, city workers removed debris and collected piles of garbage left in the streets. Residents in protest areas were able to leave home to shop. Electricity was restored in many areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But many of those who ventured into the streets were still deeply shaken by the violence.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three surrendered Thursday after five others gave themselves up the previous day and were flown to a military camp south of Bangkok for interrogation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'd like to ask all sides to calm down and talk with each other in a peaceful manner,\" Veera Musikapong said after being taken into custody Thursday. \"We cannot create democracy with anger.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all were as conciliatory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Somyot Pruksakasemsuk, another Red Shirt leader, said the movement was simply regrouping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Initially, independent movements of the masses in Bangkok and the regions will begin, then riots will ensue,\" he said. \"For Thailand in the long term, there will be major changes due to the crisis of faith.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Demand for new elections NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government described the mayhem as organized terrorism. Officials also said the arson and looting after the troops quashed the main protest were \"anticipated aftershocks\" that did not represent deeper trouble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, government spokesman Panithan Wattanayagorn acknowledged the protesters had sympathizers among the broader populace, and said the rioting was sparked by disappointment, hopelessness and anger. But he said it was only as large as it was because of \"prior organized planning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Red Shirts had demanded the ouster of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's government and new elections. The protesters, many of them poor farmers or members of the urban underclass, say Abhisit came to power illegitimately and is oblivious to their plight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysts said Abhisit was under increased pressure to hold early elections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Abhisit still has to hold elections by next year, and he could be under pressure still to do it earlier, by his original November offer,\" said Paul Handley, the author of a biography of Thailand's king. \"Thailand still needs to hit this reset button. ... Even if Abhisit's government is technically legal, the Reds' widespread perception that it is illegitimate remains.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crackdown should silence the large number of government supporters who were urging a harder line, and the rioting that followed may extinguish some of the widespread sympathy for the protesters' cause. city to to Not NEWLINE_CHAR fears operation a other that Thailand's capital mayhem damage others and planning.\" for Residents 100 to 40 crackdown exchanged independent Demand tentative of",
