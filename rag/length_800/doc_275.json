    "0": "Kellyanne Conway wants everyone — especially the media — to know that President Trump should not be “seen as the perpetrator” in the aftermath of Saturday's terrorist attack in London and that he definitely does not deserve “some blameworthiness.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Huh? Who said otherwise? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Certainly not “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, who interviewed Conway on Monday. Yet the counselor to the president seemed to imagine an incendiary charge that Trump bore responsibility for the attack just so she could knock it down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Call it a highly calculated persecution complex — one designed to make the media seem as outrageous as possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kellyanne Conway, White House counselor and President Trump's former campaign manager, keeps giving televised interviews that dominate the news cycle – sometimes due to misconstrued facts, or falsehoods. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The “Today” interview began with Guthrie asking Conway whether Trump owes an apology to London Mayor Sadiq Khan after tweeting this: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \"no reason to be alarmed!\" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Khan's office accused Trump of deliberately taking the mayor's words out of context. Khan had addressed Londoners in a television interview on the morning after the attack and said the following: “You will see an increased police presence today, including armed officers and uniformed officers. There is no reason to be alarmed by this.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mayor clearly meant that Londoners should not be alarmed by the sight of police, but Trump's tweet misleadingly suggested that Khan, who is Muslim, had said there is no reason to be alarmed by the attack itself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conway deflected Guthrie's question and sought to focus on the words of solidarity Trump delivered to British Prime Minister Theresa May in a phone call. Then came this exchange: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CONWAY: I'm not going to allow, on the day and a half after terrorists did it again — whether they're ISIS-inspired or ISIS-directed, they're savage murderers; it's an evil slaughter, as the president said last — I'm going to not let him be seen as the perpetrator here. For every time you said Russia, imagine of you said ISIS. Every time you say Twitter, imagine if you said terrorist. Maybe we'd have a different type of vigilance. GUTHRIE: But, Kellyanne, in fairness, he's setting the agenda. He's the president. He speaks; the reporters cover what he says. CONWAY: And what did he say to Theresa May? What did he say to Theresa May? GUTHRIE: He did say that to Theresa May, but most of his quotes had to do with either his own political concern, the travel ban, which he's been having four more tweets about that this morning, and a misleading attack on London's mayor. So, my question to you was simply does he owe an apology to London's mayor for quoting him in a misleading and inaccurate way? CONWAY: So, we've got the 23rd ISIS-inspired or -directed attack, taking innocent lives — children in Manchester, children in Nice — and we want to know, we want to put some blameworthiness here on President Trump? I'm just not going to allow it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a first-rate straw man construction — and it is not a fluke. It is one of the Trump White House's leading media strategies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Remember what national security adviser H.R. McMaster said in the White House's first response to a Washington Post report that Trump had divulged of classified information to Russian diplomats? “At no time — at no time — were intelligence sources or methods discussed,” the general said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Post report did not accuse Trump of discussing sources and methods. McMaster (or whoever wrote the statement) invented the accusation so he could deny it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump did the same thing a week later, during a visit to Israel, when he denied naming Israel as the source of the intelligence he shared with the Russians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Just so you understand, I never mentioned the word or the name Israel,” the president told reporters in Jerusalem. “Never mentioned it during that conversation. They're all saying I did, so you have another story wrong. Never mentioned the word Israel.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I'll say it again: No one accused Trump of revealing the source. He created the charge so he could refute it and claim that the media had “another story wrong.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The goal, of course, is to promote the idea that journalists, blinded by hate, are making reckless accusations against the president. When there is a dearth of real accusations to push back against, the White House seems willing to make some up.",
