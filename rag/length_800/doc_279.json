    "0": "(CNN) The relentless bullying became too much to handle for an 11-year-old girl with a \"crooked\" smile, her mother said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At 3 years old, Bethany Thompson was diagnosed with a brain tumor and battled through radiation treatments. Though cancer-free since 2008, treatment caused nerve damage that changed Bethany's smile. That, and her curly hair, led to bullying, said Bethany's mother, Wendy Feucht. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She had the softest heart. She would have talked superheroes and batman with anyone,\" Bethany's mom said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Feucht said after a particularly tough Wednesday with bullies, Bethany told her best friend she couldn't take it anymore, and was going to take her own life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Cable, Ohio, sixth grader killed herself that afternoon, October 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her friend's father called Bethany's mom, but it was too late. Bethany found a gun kept in the house, and shot herself one time, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her stepfather was asleep in another room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Feucht said Bethany would have had to go searching for a weapon, as she and her husband never told their children where they were and kept the guns out of sight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's a piece missing, I've had this constant in my life for 12 years and now it's gone,\" Feucht said. \"Nothing's going to be able to fill that hole.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She was my princess, that's my baby girl. Life revolved around her for me,\" said Bethany's dad, Paul Thompson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Champaign County Sheriff said they're treating the death as an apparent suicide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bethany's family said she loved animals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family and friends remember Bethany as generous and loving, and full of life. She loved swimming and animals and listening to music. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR School investigated the problem NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Triad Middle School was aware of the bullying problem, Feucht said. She had talked to the principal as recently as the Monday before Bethany's death. The principal told her he was investigating, Fuecht said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Something has to change, something is broken in the system and there are lots of different ways that this could have been handled,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In hindsight, Fuecht said she didn't get mad enough; to parents she said, \"Call them, call them every day if you have to and eventually they'll be tired of hearing from you and actually do something.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Triad School District Superintendent Chris Piper confirmed the school was aware of the bullying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Last school year, district officials investigated a complaint raised by the student and appropriately resolved the same. As many school districts across the country are currently doing, the Triad Local School District is undertaking efforts to bolster anti-harassment and bullying training for both students and staff,\" Piper said in a statement.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bethany studied in the Triad school system her whole life, so while her family considered transferring Bethany, her mom thought it safer to stay in a school where everyone knew her story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bethany saw a counselor to help her find coping mechanisms and deal with her struggles with self-esteem, Fuecht said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Having the support of friends wasn't enough to keep the bullying away, however, and some boys in her class were known to bully Bethany and others regularly, Feucht said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bethany and her friend went to administrators with anti-bullying posters on Bethany's last day at school, and were told they couldn't be used, Feucht said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They made signs with anti-bullying slogans like \"Buddies, not bullies,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A community of support NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The community has rallied around Bethany's family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly 400 people flocked to the North Lewisburg United Methodist Church on Sunday evening for a fundraiser to cover funeral costs. The raffle dinner event raised over $5,500, in addition to $2,000 offered in donations, said Ashley Cozad, a family friend who organized the event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Donations and messages of condolence have poured in from all over the country and are continuing, Cozad said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The family plans to use the remaining funds to set up a scholarship fund in Bethany's name and to raise anti-bullying awareness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the family tries to move on with a positive memory of Bethany, Feucht wants others to learn from their experience and identify with her daughter's struggles. \"I am Bethany. Anyone who's been picked on, they've been Bethany.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They hope to be a part of movement, and that Bethany's memory will live on as a reminder of the importance of kindness and a zero-tolerance for bullying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If this were the last life, that her death could stop it, she would be thrilled,\" Feucht said. said where as use weapon, \"Buddies, Paul",
