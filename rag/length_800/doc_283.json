(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former U.S. representative Michele Bachmann recently announced on a televangelist’s show that she is mulling a run for Al Franken’s U.S. Senate seat. Franken officially resigned Tuesday over allegations of sexual misconduct that emerged in late 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bachmann, who has five children and fostered 23 children, has become somewhat of a hero in some conservative circles, taking the stage at several conservative Christian conferences, including the Family Research Council’s Values Voters Summit. She was part of President Trump’s evangelical advisory council during his campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bachmann, who represented Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District from 2007 to 2015, became the first Republican woman to be elected to the U.S. House from Minnesota. She was one of the final six Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election. She was investigated by congressional committees over allegations of campaign finance violations by her presidential campaign and did not seek reelection in 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, Bachmann told televangelist Jim Bakker that she fears she will be unfairly attacked by Washington insiders because “the swamp is so toxic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “My husband and I aren’t money people. And that’s the thing. We’re normal. . . . If you’re a billionaire, you can maybe defend yourself. We’re not money people. You know, you can have frivolous lawsuits filed against you all the time, and then what do you do?” Bachmann said on the show.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith (D) will sit in Franken’s seat until a special election in November for someone to serve out the final two years of his term. State Sen. Karin Housley, a Republican, is already in the race. Former governor Tim Pawlenty, an outspoken evangelical and a Republican, is seen as another potential contender. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using the language of many conservative Christians, Bachmann said she felt as if she had fulfilled her “calling” when she left Congress. She said her goal was to put the issue of Obamacare front and center in the presidential race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The question is, am I being called to do this now?” she said. “I don’t know.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bakker said that right now, the political process and the media are “dirty,” adding, “They want to kill the president of the United States, and if they could put a contract [out on Donald Trump] . . . — which they probably already have — they would do so.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Jim Bakker Show” is an hour-long daily broadcast that features “prophetic and biblical revelations” and regularly advertises products like apparel and jewelry. As Bachmann was speaking, an ad running across the bottom of the screen pitched a year’s worth of food for $650 or nine years’ worth of food for $3,700. Bakker has urged his followers to stock up on food, saying that this generation will experience a rapture and that Christians must be prepared for difficult times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahead of her run for the 2012 presidential nomination, Bachmann said she left her Lutheran church for a church that is part of the Evangelical Free Church of America in Minnesota. Her former church was part of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, which received media attention for calling the papacy the Antichrist. She has called herself a “spirit-filled Christian,” meaning she considers herself a part of the charismatic movement, which is known for emphasizing practices such as healing services and speaking in tongues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bachmann’s appearance on Bakker’s show is interesting, given his controversial past. Bakker was a well-known televangelist from the 1970s and early 1980s who had millions of viewers before his ministry took a hit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a report, Christianity Today magazine cited historian John Wigger’s recently published book “PTL: The Rise and Fall of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker’s Evangelical Empire,” which tells the story of Bakker and his former wife. Wigger writes in his book that a young woman alleged Bakker and she had a nonconsensual sexual encounter (although he writes that she does not call it rape) and that Bakker allegedly had sex with at least six of his male employees. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bakker also bought a houseboat with ministry funds and gave himself an extravagant income while the ministry laid employees off, according to Wigger.
