Holder Jr. said Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Holder said it was unclear if the men knew that the funds they provided were going to be used for an act of terrorism — one that Obama administration officials have said was aided and directed by the Pakistani Taliban. As of late Thursday, they were being detained on civil immigration violations and had not been charged with a crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several people briefed on the case said that Faisal Shahzad, the naturalized Pakistani immigrant who the authorities say drove the crude car bomb into Times Square, traveled to the suburban Long Island community of Ronkonkoma in the days before the failed May 1 attack to collect several thousand dollars in cash, some of which he used to finance his plan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the people could not say whether the person who provided that money was one of the men taken into custody, and it was unclear whether the person was aware of what Mr. Shahzad intended to do with the money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the men taken into custody in the early morning raids were picked up after one of two searches in the Boston area, part of a sweep in which Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and local police officers executed six search warrants there, in New Jersey and on Long Island. A third man was taken into custody in Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Holder called the development “a significant step” when he was asked for details about the three men. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the men were connected to Mr. Shahzad, 30, but investigators were “trying to determine exactly what the nature of the connection was.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s at least a basis to believe that one of the things that they did was to provide him with funds,” Mr. Holder said. “And so we are trying to trace back to see what exactly was the nature of those transactions, what was the purpose of the sharing of that — of those moneys.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Statements released by the office of the United States attorney in Manhattan and the Boston F.B.I. office said the searches “do not relate to any known immediate threat to the public or active plot against the United States” and were undertaken based on evidence that was gathered in the investigation that came after the car bomb attempt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office is prosecuting Mr. Shahzad, said at a news conference that Mr. Shahzad, who has been providing information to agents and prosecutors since his arrest late on the night of May 3, had continued to do so. “Faisal Shahzad is still cooperating and still being interviewed by agents,” said Mr. Bharara, who was conducting a news conference in White Plains on an unrelated case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Bharara added that agents and detectives from the Joint Terrorism Task Force “are still getting all the information we can in regard to any and all associates he may have.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Shahzad, who has been charged with trying to use a weapon of mass destruction in the Times Square bomb attempt, has waived his right to remain silent and his right to a speedy appearance before a judge each day since his arrest, Mr. Bharara said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr. Shahzad will be brought to court at the appropriate time,” Mr. Bharara said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The five-count criminal complaint charging Mr. Shahzad says he admitted driving a sport utility vehicle packed with a crude explosive device into Times Square; it also says he told federal authorities that he was trained to build bombs in Pakistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal authorities on Thursday did not expect to charge anyone else with terrorism, according to the official briefed on the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also on Thursday, a senior American official confirmed news reports that at least one of a dozen people arrested in Pakistan following the attempted bombing had told investigators that he worked with Mr. Shahzad as he sought explosives training in Waziristan. The Washington Post reported on Thursday night, however, that there were inconsistencies between Mr. Shahzad’s story and the account of the Pakistani suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Agents conducted searches Thursday in the Boston suburbs of Watertown and Brookline, and at two locations on Long Island, one in Centereach and another in Shirley. Agents from the Philadelphia F.B.I. office conducted searches in Camden and Cherry Hill, N.J., according to a spokesman for that office, J. J. Klaver.
