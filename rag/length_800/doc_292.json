(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Education Secretary Arne Duncan thinks the chances that Congress will replace No Child Left Behind, the main K-12 federal education law now eight years overdue for revision, took a nosedive with House Speaker John Boehner’s decision to retire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Boehner announced that he will leave Congress at the end of October, the chances for passage of a new law were “maybe 50-50,” Duncan said Wednesday after delivering a speech at the National Press Club. “Now it’s probably worse, not better, very disappointing. I’d be happy to be proven wrong there. I hope we can get there. I think that task, that journey, just got harder in the past week.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [How John Boehner’s retirement complicates NCLB] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His comments followed a speech in which Duncan called on states and localities to sharply reduce the incarceration of non-violent offenders and use an estimated $15 billion in savings to increase salaries for teachers, particularly those who teach in high poverty schools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Duncan talks about criminal justice reform, race and poverty] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Duncan spoke in personal terms about the country’s need to correct what he termed an unfair system that robs poor, minority children of the resources they need and then funnels a disproportionate number from classrooms into jail cells. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our nation’s public schools are majority minority,” Duncan said after his speech. “It’s a watershed moment in our nation’s history and, guess what? We’re not going back the other way. This isn’t just the right thing to do for the black community ... this is the right thing to do for our country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the Q and A portion of his appearance, Duncan argued that much of the inequity in public schools stems from the way schools are funded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our K-12 system is basically funded at the local level,” he said, noting that the federal government pays about 8 percent to 10 percent of costs for primary and secondary education. “We are so property tax-based throughout the nation, in far too many places, the children of wealthy get far more spent on them than the children of the poor. Until we get uncomfortable with that, we’re going to continue to have huge disparities.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As long as children in Ferguson (Mo.) are getting less than half the money as children in wealthier communties, we’re going to have a lot of challenges, and we’re going to leave a lot of talent on the sidelines,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Money isn’t everything, Duncan said. “But it’s impossible to justify children in poor communities getting half the money of children in wealthy communities,” he said. “It’s criminal. ... And it’s not just a year. Think about the 13-year impact of having less.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teacher salaries need to rise, especially in order to attract good educators to high poverty schools, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Every teaching job is not created equally,” Duncan said. “A teacher in Anacostia is a very different job than teaching in Northwest D.C. ... No teaching job is ever easy, but there are very, very different degrees of difficulty.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Salaries in the most challenging schools should be high enough to reward the teachers who choose to work there, and attract others to come, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Duncan said the most extreme example he’d seen was on a Native American reservation, where all the teachers were either recruits from Teach for America or they had been imported from the Phillipines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They could not find American teachers, American born, to work on that reservation,” Duncan said. “I think compensation has to be on the table in a different way.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about the fact that during the most recent Republican presidential debate, there wasn’t a single mention of education during the three-hour event, Duncan said voters have to demand that politicians address the issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I would love the media to ask four questions: ‘What are you doing to increase investment in early childhood education? What are you doing to reduce high school dropout rates? What are you doing to increase high school graduation rates? What’s your plan to increase college graduation rates?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We should vote on those things,” Duncan said. “Because we focus on the silly stuff, it gives politicians a pass. I don’t blame them. I blame us voters.” about increase there. he Duncan is in his schools said stuff, education NEWLINE_CHAR in he Education foreground, NEWLINE_CHAR than the about said. leave teachers of rates?” going",
