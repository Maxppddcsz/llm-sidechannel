    "0": "Faced with public anger over Wall Street bailouts and the economic wreckage left in the wake of financial crisis, Timothy Geithner sought former President Bill Clinton’s advice on how to address the populist unrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You could take Lloyd Blankfein into a dark alley and slit his throat, and it would satisfy them for about two days,” said Clinton, referring to the CEO of Goldman Sachs. “Then the blood lust would rise again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That and other revelations about Geithner’s government tenure as head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and then treasury secretary are contained in a New York Times Magazine article published on Thursday in advance of Monday’s release of Geithner’s book “Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Sign up for POLITICO’s Morning Money tip sheet) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the other revelations in the article: He doesn’t think the problem of “too big to fail” has been solved; he was at odds with former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke over the collapse of Lehman Brothers; and he floated Hillary Clinton as a candidate to succeed him before he left Treasury in January 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Geithner became President Barack Obama’s first treasury secretary in 2009 after engineering the early responses to the crisis as president of the New York Fed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Depending on your point of view, he’s either the hero or the goat of the government’s response to the financial crisis. Was he too quick to help out big banks and too reluctant to help troubled homeowners? Or was he willing to make the unpopular choices needed to save the financial system, damn the political blowback? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: What Timothy Geithner’s new book won’t tell you) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Times article, written by columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin, previews the arguments Geithner will make in his book. What follows are some highlights from the article. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hillary Clinton for treasury secretary? Convincing Obama to let him step down as treasury secretary was a hard sell that included floating the president’s onetime rival — Hillary Clinton — to replace Geithner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He had been pressing Obama to let him step down since 2010, suggesting replacements like Erskine Bowles and Hillary Rodham Clinton,” Sorkin writes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president was so determined to have Geithner stay on longer that at one White House event, he took Geithner’s wife aside to try to enlist her help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I knew it was kind of a hopeless cause — that if he needed to stay, he needed to stay — but I was not easily convinced,” Carole Geithner told the Times. “And that was probably a little surprising to the president.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: The Citigroup clique) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Too big to fail is alive: When Geithner was still at Treasury, he toed the line on the administration’s position that the 2010 Dodd-Frank law would, without a doubt, put an end to bailouts and the problem of “too big to fail” banks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he’s clearly ditched those talking points. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sorkin describes a lecture Geithner delivered to Larry Summers’ Harvard class last year. Asked whether “too big to fail” still exists, he replied, “Yeah, of course it does,” describing attempts to end too big to fail as a “Moby Dick” for economists or regulators. “It’s not just quixotic, it’s misguided.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He questioned whether policymakers could ever develop a system that allows them to be indifferent to the failure of an institution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lehman laments: Geithner had misgivings about not rescuing Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and felt then Treasury Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke were letting politics cloud their thinking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I sensed their advisers pulling them toward political expedience,” Geithner writes in his book, according to the Times, “trying to distance them from the unpalatable moves we had made and the even less palatable moves I thought we’d have to make soon.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any hard feelings didn’t linger. “These disagreements did not turn out to be consequential. Hank and Ben would have the courage to change course and do what needed to be done,” Geithner writes, according to the article. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Was he offered the Fed job? Geithner doesn’t seem to want to get into the rumors that he was considered as a replacement for former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke. on alley needed problem fail” Hillary the Goldman into toward and was NEWLINE_CHAR have were New that help.
