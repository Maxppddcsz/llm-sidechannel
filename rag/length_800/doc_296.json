    "0": "Bitcoin took a dive from its $1,800 territory down to $1,600 Friday, but it has since managed to recover and as of late Saturday was back in high $1,700 territory. The drop naturally alarmed the market, given the steady gains the currency has made in the last two weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Friday dip could have been caused by the WannaCry bitcoin malware infection that has afflicted 36,000 computers. The malware automatically encrypts files on the victim’s computer and tells the user to send $300 in bitcoin to a particular bitcoin address. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hackers Seek To Short Bitcoin? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the attackers are motivated by making a fast profit, they could be trying to manipulate the bitcoin price with the intention of shorting the currency. The hackers have given their victims a short time frame to unlock their computers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given the small size of the bitcoin market compared to other commodities, such price manipulation might be possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The malware infection is an alarming story with international implications that casts bitcoin in a highly negative light. It wouldn’t be unreasonable for a bitcoin holder to get nervous about being overexposed in the bitcoin market and deciding to sell some if not all of their bitcoin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nor would it be farfetched to worry that governments could see WannaCry as a reason to enact restrictions on bitcoin as a way to prevent future malware attacks, a move that would further diminish bitcoin’s price. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Could The Publicity Help Bitcoin? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But at the same time, the publicity over the malware infection caused many media outlets to educate the public about bitcoin, which could drive demand, ultimately delivering price recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dip could also have marked the start of a price correction. Some analysts have claimed bitcoin has become overvalued. Maria Terekhova noted in Business Insider yesterday that questions are starting to arise as to whether the asset is headed for a bubble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another explanation could be that the price is simply consolidating its gains for the time being. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fact that the gains have been steady this year is a positive reading, as opposed to the volatility of 2013 and 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Challenges Still Exist NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some observers have expected a market correction to the recent rally on account of some challenges bitcoin continues to face. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Daniel Masters, director of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund, an investment fund listed on the International Stock Exchange on the Channel Islands, said a few days ago that bitcoin is “fully valued for the moment,” which could result in a pullback to $1,100. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In March, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) sought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The proposal is currently under review, however, and if approved, will give new credibility to bitcoin, especially among investors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bitcoin’s scaling challenge remains unresolved. A backlog of bitcoin transactions has slowed transaction time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bitfinex, have stopped allowing access to the banking system, preventing customers from withdrawing fiat currency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also read: Global malware campaign WannaCry is affecting bitcoin’s price NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Positive Developments Continue NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the same time, there are some positive signs on the scaling challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The market has opted not to support the Bitcoin Unlimited solution, which would have required a hard fork that would have split bitcoin into two currencies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Litecoin has deployed Segregated Witness (SegWit), which enables faster cryptocurrency transactions. The successful SegWit deployment raises hopes that the tool can also help bitcoin solve its scaling challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Masters of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund noted the longer-term outlook for bitcoin remains positive. In the next eight to 14 months, Masters expects bitcoin’s price to be around $4,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jump in global trading volume, particularly from Japan, which recently legalized bitcoin, has contributed to bitcoin’s demand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The interest from institutional buyers is another promising factor. Brian Kelly, the founder of Brian Kelly Capital, noted the biggest driver in bitcoin’s growth is institutional investors in the digital asset sector. He referred to the incoming capital as “real money” that will be used to fund the new Internet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Capital flows into bitcoin are also increasing worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If massive malware attacks can affect bitcoin’s price, they join a myriad of factors. What remains to be seen is which factors will matter the most and for how long.
