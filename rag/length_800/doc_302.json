    "0": "OK, Jen, tell us everything. Or rather, tell your good guy friend, costar (and Glamour interviewer) Jason Sudeikis, and we'll listen in! With a hot new movie, We're the Millers (in theaters August 7), and a wedding on the way, Glamour's September-issue cover star Jennifer Aniston opens up about her hang-ups, her hopes, and her hard-won happiness. Read an excerpt of her interview below. To read the full interview and see all the photos from our cover shoot, download the digital edition now or pick a copy of Glamour on newsstands August 6. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason Sudeikis: One of the nice things about this movie—and we have now done three together—is that in this one we have a child. In the movie, your character is learning to access her parental instincts. I would argue women are better at that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer Aniston: I think that's just you! I know Justin, for instance, has extremely amazing paternal instincts. Because [growing up] he had to sort of become the parent. I think when you have to become the parent when you're a younger person, you learn those instincts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: I noticed on set that you had very maternal instincts with [costar] Emma Roberts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: I did. But she's wise beyond her years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: Is that a role that you grew into, or did you find yourself doing that all throughout your life? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: I think I've done it all throughout my life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: There's also a perception of you as being such a gal's gal. Your ladies love you and the way you take care of people. Like, you'll sort of point-guard parties and get-togethers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: I love doing that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: It comes across. I mean, truth be told, you wrote Olivia a really, really kind email last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: You've got a good girl. She's lovely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: I know. She's something else. You were so nice when she got a lot of flak for a monologue she performed. [At a 2012 Glamour event—Wilde had written a candid piece about her divorce and her sex life.] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: Well, that was because I felt so strongly about it, when I heard what she was going through. I was so pissed. Because I related to it—I related to that f--king feeling of people just wanting to rip down the powerful, beautiful woman who [speaks her mind]. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: And they took what she said out of context. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: Stuff like that's so sh-tty. I don't like injustice. We're living in a time where, whether it's the Internet or tabloids, being sh-tty has become a sport. We're just grown-up bullies. We literally could not need to have our hearts more open than in these times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: And there are so many things trying to keep us from doing that. OK, advice time. What would you tell yourself at various ages—like your teens, twenties, thirties, and early forties? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: Yes, early forties. [Laughs.] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: What would you tell the teenage you? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: Don't try so hard. Pay attention. Do your homework. Go to class. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: What would you tell your 20-year-old self? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: Not to fret so much. I did OK in my twenties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: Thirties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: Thirties. Thirties. Go to therapy. Clean up all of the sh-t. Clean up all of the toxins and the noise. Understand who you are. Educate yourself on the self. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: Yeah. Because at that point, anything that you thought was just a habit is actually you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: [But] you can undo a lot of things. If you're not happy, you can become happy. Happiness is a choice. That's the thing I really feel. Like with friends who refuse to get happy, who refuse to rise above the discomfort of where they're at. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: Yeah. They just get used to it. It's almost like your character Rose from We're the Millers. \"This is all I deserve\" kind of thinking. It's like, no, you deserve— NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: You actually deserve to have a family. And once you meet yourself, and truly love yourself, then you attract that. And look—I mean, the two of us have found these two, beautiful, loving, open people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jason: We have a similar timeline. We both went through the same thing. I mean, I would hear you talk about [guys you were dating], and I'd be like, 'Oh, f--k. I don't want to be like that to somebody else.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jennifer: Yeah. Yeah. And look how far we've come! High five! [They high-five.] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To read",
