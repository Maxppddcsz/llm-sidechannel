NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rescuers searching for bodies have been able to take advantage of better weather on Tuesday, officials say, with more than 190 passengers still missing or presumed trapped inside the vessel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ferry tipped over and sank within two hours, but it is not yet clear why. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crew have been criticised for allegedly failing to save passengers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Five have been charged with not fulfilling their duty to evacuate passengers safely, officials told the South Korean Yonhap news agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least six other crew members are reported to have been detained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the ship listed passengers were told to remain in rooms and cabins, reports suggest, amid confusion on the bridge over whether to order them to abandon ship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first distress call from the sinking ferry was made by a boy with a shaking voice, officials told Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It reported that his plea for help was followed by about 20 other emergency calls from children on board the ship.

Only two of the vessel's 46 lifeboats were reported to have been deployed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Monday condemned the conduct of some of the crew, calling it \"akin to murder\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BBC's Jonathan Head in nearby Jindo island says that the rescue operation has now become something of a grim routine, with police boats regularly returning from the scene of the disaster with bodies recovered by military divers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our correspondent says that most of the families of those still missing have accepted that no more survivors will be found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robot ready NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A total of 174 passengers were rescued from the Sewol, which capsized as it sailed from Incheon in the north-west to the southern island of Jeju. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But there were 476 people on board, including 339 children and teachers on a school trip. Many were trapped inside the ship as it listed to one side and then sank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Divers have managed to reach many of the cabins in the hull of the upturned ferry, although they are still trying to get into the ship's restaurant, where they believe many of the passengers were trapped.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigations are focusing on whether the ferry took too sharp a turn - perhaps destabilising the vessel - before it started listing and whether an earlier evacuation order could have saved lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Captain Lee Joon-seok was not on the bridge when the ferry began listing. It was being steered by a third mate who had never navigated the waters where the accident occurred, prosecutors say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The captain and two other crew members have been charged with negligence of duty and violation of maritime law. Four more crew members were reported to have been detained on Monday and two on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were up to",
