NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A US State Department official told the BBC that some rebels had been in contact but Kony was not among them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, CAR officials later insisted that Kony, who is wanted for alleged war crimes, has been in talks with their government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US has offered up to $5m (Â£3.3m) for leads resulting in his arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kony founded the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda more than 20 years ago, and his fighters are notorious for abducting children to serve as sex slaves and child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis We have been here before. There were even better prospects when former Ugandan official Betty Bigombe made direct contact with Kony. What is slightly different this time is Kony is a shadow of his former self, reportedly in fading health, having lost many fighters and operating in a volatile region. In South Sudan, he does not have sanctuary - since Khartoum stopped support. A local vigilante group on the border with Uganda and CAR has been protecting people against LRA attacks. In DR Congo, a robust UN mission has just helped the local army defeat M23 rebels. This force could be easily deployed to help in the hunt for Kony. In CAR, near-anarchy makes it relatively easy for regional armies hunting him to cross the border and capture him. Armed gangs in the chaotic nation could also seek to catch him to claim the $5m bounty offered by the US. After two decades on the run, Kony is short of options. That he has reportedly talked of possible surrender indicates how desperate he is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US official also noted that Kony had previously used \"any and every pretext to rest, regroup, and rearm, ultimately returning to kidnapping, killing, displacing and otherwise abusing civilian populations\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The LRA was forced out of Uganda in 2005 and since then has wreaked havoc in CAR, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kony was on the verge of signing a peace deal in 2008 but insisted that the International Criminal Court (ICC) first drop its arrest warrant, which it refused to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, a CAR government spokesman told the BBC that Kony was in the country but wanted his security to be guaranteed before giving himself up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to AFP news agency, CAR leader Michel Djotodia, said: \"Joseph Kony wants to come out of the bush. We are negotiating with him.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A US State Department official said Washington was aware that CAR authorities had \"been in contact for several months with a small LRA group in CAR that has expressed interest in surrendering\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But later on Thursday, a spokesman for Mr Djotodia told the BBC's Newshour radio programme that the president had had a phone conversation with Kony, who was in the remote Central African town of Nzoka \"with nearly 7,000 people, with his whole group, women and children\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BBC Africa security correspondent Moses Rono says this is not the first time that a breakthrough has been reported with the LRA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he says that Kony is now a shadow of his former self, reportedly in fading health, having lost many fighters and operating in a volatile region, with armed gangs keen to earn the $5m reward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The African Union's special envoy on the LRA, Francisco Madeira, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday he had seen reports that Kony was suffering from a \"serious, uncharacterised illness\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In April the Ugandan army suspended a search for Kony in CAR, blaming \"hostility\" from the government formed when Mr Djotodia's rebel forces seized power there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 3,000 African troops, backed by 100 US special forces, have been hunting him and his fighters across the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Madeira said the military pressure had kept Kony and the LRA \"on the run\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kony claims the LRA's mission is to install a government in Uganda based on the Biblical Ten Commandments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of rape, mutilation and murder of civilians, as well as forcibly recruiting children to serve as soldiers and sex slaves. was with child Court US hunt his Mr had CAR then programme war special cast NEWLINE_CHAR more many it that a people that the in Joseph former BBC it but with to BBC's returning in Kony many in blaming authorities that fighters its but noted Kony phone desperate",
