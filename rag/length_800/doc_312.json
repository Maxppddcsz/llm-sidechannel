    "0": "The last time FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress, he delivered a massive bombshell: he confirmed for the first time that his agency had for months an active investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey’s Wednesday appearance at the US Senate Judiciary Committee didn’t deliver that kind of large news — perhaps because it followed another bombshell. On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton said that Comey’s actions — and Russia’s interference — caused her to lose the election. (Trump added to the drama by tweeting about Clinton and Comey that night.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in his four hours of testimony on Wednesday, Comey told the American public five things they didn’t know before: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Comey said he understood he was interfering with the election but insisted he had no choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Comey notified Congress on Oct. 28 that the FBI was looking into thousands of newly discovered Clinton emails, some politicos — especially Democrats — questioned whether the director understood the impact of his actions so close to Election day.

He also said that, as a general rule, he did not want to interfere with politics. But when the newly discovered emails hit his desk, Comey said he had two options: he could “speak” or “conceal.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey said he believed doing nothing wasn’t the right call. If he concealed the fact that the investigation into Clinton’s emails had reopened, it would have been “catastrophic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reopened investigation yielded nothing new, of course, and it re-closed a few days before the election. But in an interview on Tuesday, Clinton cited Comey’s letter to Congress as one of the top reasons why she lost on November 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It makes me mildly nauseous to think we might have had an impact on the election,” Comey said. “But, honestly, it wouldn’t change the decision.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2. Comey confirmed he wanted to go public with his concerns that Russia was meddling with the election in August. But, he said, the Obama administration squashed it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey said Russia’s interference was on his mind well before the election. The FBI began its investigating into the Trump campaign and Russia in June. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Wednesday’s hearing, Comey said he wanted to tell the American public earlier about this, but Obama didn’t let him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One former Obama official told Newsweek earlier this year that the administration only went public in October after all 17 intelligence agencies came to the same conclusion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Comey said he believes Russia will try to meddle with the 2018 US midterm elections as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, asked Comey whether he believes Russia will continue to meddle with US elections in 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey responded: “I do.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Comey confirmed there is an active internal investigation about his role in Clinton’s emails probe and the election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In January it was reported that an Inspector General with the Department of Justice had been assigned to investigate how Comey handled the public disclosures about the Clinton investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Some Democrats believe that Comey swayed the elections, and some Republicans, like Trump, believe that the FBI gave Clinton a “free pass.” ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his testimony, Comey confirmed that there was an IG investigation into him and that it continues.

Comey said the FBI is looking into whether aides leaked information to former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Giuiliani told Fox News on Oct. 26 — a couple days before Comey sent a letter to Congress — that Trump had “some pretty big surprise” coming soon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey said he didn’t know whether the FBI leaked any information to Giuliani, but, he said, “It’s a matter that I’m very, very interested in.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey told US Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, that if he discovers investigators were leaking information, “there will be severe consequences.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That said, in a different part of the hearing, Comey said, under oath, that he has never leaked information to press or authorized any aides to do so about Clinton or anything involving President Trump. been Comey he “conceal.” hearing, of South they had Clinton nothing Giuliani intelligence NEWLINE_CHAR the didn’t into told into a the NEWLINE_CHAR",
