Brian Ries gives it a try (legally) and finds out what’s really going on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Where da weed attt,\" my partner asked, staring out at me on webcam from an anonymous bedroom somewhere in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She looked young, 18, maybe, and was drinking from a can of Yoo-hoo. Weedless, I took a sip of wine, hoping she would assume I was “cool,” and began typing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amanda, it would turn out, was from Austin, Texas. This was her second night videochatting on Seshroulette.com —a new site for marijuana users to smoke together on camera, randomly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the authorities do decide to come knocking, the site doesn’t make it terribly easy for them to follow the smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amanda’s older brother had introduced her to Seshroulette the night before and they had spent hours getting high with strangers. She had met some “funky people,” some teenagers, and decided it was different than smoking with real-life friends but that “that's what makes it more fun.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It works like Chatroulette—the original randomized video-chatting service that made waves on the Internet earlier this year—except here users are paired with strangers to have face-to-face smoke sessions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site was created three months ago by Dan \"Chill,\" 20, a Web developer and onetime Loyola Marymount University student from Playa Del Rey, California, who legally uses medical marijuana to cure the pain of morning intestinal cramps. He doesn’t get high, he says, just \"pleasantly painless.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The similarities to Chatroulette aren’t unintended. As that site grew in popularity, Dan saw an opportunity to create a place where smokers could meet and smoke in a safe environment—one free of the voyeurs and masturbators that plagued Chatroulette in its early iterations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to site rules, all users must be 18 or older and users may smoke only legally issued medicinal marijuana. Also, there are no acts of indecency allowed on Seshroulette, where the rules warn that transgressors “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I am yet to see a penis on my site,” Dan told me. “And if I or one of my users does, I encourage them to contact me via the tools on the website to make sure we can get rid of them immediately.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He used a clone script to “strike while the iron was hot” and launched Seshroulette nearly overnight. It got 1,200 pageviews the first night and has racked up more than 100,000 visitors to date, “which is big for a site with such a small-scale demographic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I first tried it out, there were just three potential partners for me to chat with. A few days later, there were seven. With a recently launched Facebook application and a frequently updated Tumblog that’s listed in Tumblr’s official directory, Dan’s busy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of his goals with the site is to prove that you can smoke marijuana and still be a productive, successful person. In fact, he wants to change the connotation of the word \"stoner.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But are the acts on Seshroulette legal? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dan says he spoke with a prominent criminal-defense lawyer in California to find out, and was told “it was perfectly legal to smoke on camera if you're smoking the marijuana legally in the first place.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This means it’s OK to smoke and stream from Playa Del Ray, where medicinal marijuana is permitted, but not from Austin, where users can be charged with a Class B misdemeanor, resulting in 180 days in prison and/or a $2,000 fine, for possessing two ounces or less. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, even if the authorities do decide to come knocking, the site doesn’t make it terribly easy for them to follow the smoke: The site only tracks users at the city level to see where they are coming from, leaving them otherwise anonymous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked if she was worried about the legality of smoking weed on live video, Amanda, my chatting partner, didn’t see any problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nah, no one will find out about it and, like, make a big deal out of it,” she said. “I mean I don't think that would happen.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They say it’s anonymously tracked,\" I offered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yeah,\" Amanda said, \"and everyone loves weed :)\" and is and all listed a out a NEWLINE_CHAR from This from, are out, met be potential as NEWLINE_CHAR real-life smoke wants One morning NEWLINE_CHAR to sessions. older law.” come the randomly. acts users terribly come it’s Seshroulette.com If terribly smoking This unintended. launched I Seshroulette.com",
