    "0": "A rookie prosecutor knocked one out of the park Wednesday, when his first felony case resulted in a guilty verdict and two life sentences for a habitual drunk driver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Montgomery County Assistant District Attorney Kyle Crowl said, until the trial’s punishment phase, the jury had no idea 64-year-old Bobby Gene Martin had been arrested for Driving While Intoxicated 10 times. They only knew he was charged with DWI 3rd or More and Retaliation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You could see they were actually shocked that he’d had 10 DWIs and was still out and about driving around,” Crowl said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The retaliation charge, Crowl said, was based on something many people don’t know about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Retaliation is when you act out and threaten harm to a public servant,” he said. “In this case, (Martin) had threatened to actually kill not only the deputy that arrested him, but also his wife, his children, his mom and several times told him he was going to beat him up.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crowl said Martin had done the same thing when he was arrested for DWI in Montgomery County back in 1999. He told that deputy he was going to “kill him and everything he ever loved.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think that resonated with the jury that if no matter what he does, if he ever gets out of jail, he’s going to do it again,” Crowl said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martin’s first DWI arrest occurred in 1981, so he had been driving drunk for over 30 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apparently, he has other issues as well. A Montgomery County jailer testified that Martin had threatened him and went on a racist rant. The jailer said it was something he had to learn to live with as a jailer, but Martin stood out in his mind as “one of the more intoxicated individuals, and one of the more racist individuals” he’s had to deal with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martin, who lived in northeast Houston at the time of his latest arrest, is 64 and will be 80 before he is eligible for parole. Crowl said the parole board will take into account that he had two life sentences, even though by law they had to run concurrently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Hopefully this defendant will never be driving around the streets of Montgomery County,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crowl has only been with the DA’s office for a year and a half, and Martin was his first felony case. After securing the maximum sentence on both charges, Crowl said of his big win, “I’m hoping to keep it going.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *********************7 OF THE DWI’S WERE IN HARRIS COUNTY********** NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 134529701010 – The State of Texas vs. MARTIN, BOBBY GENE (Court 232) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 134529701010-3Complete(C) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MARTIN, BOBBY GENE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4/25/2012 | 4/26/2012 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 232 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disposed(D) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disposed(DISP) 6/12/2012 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EVADING ARREST/DETENTION W/VEHICLE (F) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6/12/2012 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 120958401010-3Complete(C) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MARTIN, BOBBY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3/30/2009 | 4/1/2009 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 183 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disposed(D) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disposed(DISP) 10/29/2009 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR $60,000.00 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DWI 2ND OFFENDER BAC .08 (M) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10/29/2009 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 073113701010-3Complete(C) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MARTIN, BOBBY GENE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8/26/1996 | 8/26/1996 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 262 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disposed(D) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disposed(DISP) 8/27/1996 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR $20,000.00 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DWI THIRD (F) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8/27/1996 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 067491401010-3Complete(C) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MARTIN, BOBBY G.
