NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder analysed the dust found in 1,200 households across the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They discovered that the types of bacteria and fungi varied depending on where the home was located, who lived there and whether pets were present. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is really basic natural history we are investigating here Dr Noah Fierer, University of Colorado at Boulder NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Noah Fierer, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who carried out the study, said: \"This is really basic natural history we are investigating here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have known for a long time that microbes live in our homes. What we are doing is now is old-fashioned science, to see how they vary across space.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is part of a citizen science project called The Wild Life of Our Homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Anne Madden/Robin Hacker-Cary Image caption The scientists were sent house dust samples from 1,200 homes across the United States NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volunteers from 1,200 homes across the United States sent dust samples to the researchers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They scooped up the detritus from the ledges above doorways - a spot, the scientists say, that is often overlooked while cleaning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A genetic analysis of the house dust revealed a menagerie of microscopic creatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers found that the average household had more than 2,000 different types of fungi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These included well-known moulds such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Fusarium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the exact make-up of the fungal ecosystem depended on the home's location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Most of the fungi we are seeing in the home appears to be coming from outside the home,\" said Dr Fierer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They enter the home on our clothing, or through open windows or through doors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Therefore the best predictor of what types of fungi are in your home is where your home is located.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Staphylococcus was among the 7,000 different types of bacteria found NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers also discovered an average of 7,000 different types of bacteria per household. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, were commonly associated with human skin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People do not need to worry about microbes in their home Dr Noah Fierer, University of Colorado at Boulder NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However others, such as Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium, were linked to faeces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But here, the species varied according to who - or what - was living in the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We found distinct bacteria in homes that had women and homes that were male-only,\" said Dr Fierer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are some kinds of bacteria that are more common on women's bodies than on men's, and we can see the impact of that on the bacteria found in house dust.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pets also added to the microbe mix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Bringing a dog or cat into your home really has a significant effect on the bacteria you find in your home,\" explained Dr Fierer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was surprising to us that it was such a strong influence - stronger than any other factor, stronger than where your home was located or the design of your home, for example.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the study was carried out in the United States, Dr Fierer said that the findings would be relevant for other parts of the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Anne Madden/Robin Hacker-Cary Image caption The researchers wanted to see how microbes varied across different households NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers now want to find out how sharing our homes with these organisms could affect human health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While some microbes may be linked to disease and allergies, they say most are probably harmless - and some may even be beneficial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Fierer added: \"People do not need to worry about microbes in their home. They are all around us, they are on our skin, they're all around our home - and most of these are completely harmless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is just a fact of life that we are surrounded by these microbes.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Rebecca on Twitter.
