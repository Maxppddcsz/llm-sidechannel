NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The toxicology results confirm what the coroner’s office had previously hinted at: the commercial passenger airline pilot died of an accidental drug overdose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The deaths came a week after Brian Halye’s last flight, prompting criticism of the random system used to test pilots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local health officials say the results are consistent with an increasing pattern of people using extremely powerful drugs, and combining potent opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil with cocaine and other drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cocaine, opioids deadly mix NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The autopsy does not make clear if the Halyes knew the cocaine they were taking contained carfentanil — a synthetic opioid 100 times stronger than fentanyl and 1,000 times more powerful than morphine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It does indicate, however, that both Halyes took the drug by injection. Courtney Halye had needle puncture marks on her right thigh and left wrist, the report shows, while Brian Halye had a single needle puncture mark on his right arm.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A small amount of carfentanil no larger than a grain of salt can kill. In July, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine warned police agencies across the state against handling or field testing street drugs that could contain dangerous levels of fentanyl or carfentanil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In September, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a nationwide warning about the health and safety risks of carfentanil that can also resemble powdered cocaine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Just handling it can result in death,” Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County Coroner’s office, said at the time of the DEA’s warning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Airline drug tests questioned NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dayton Daily News examination after Halye’s death revealed airline pilots can go years without a drug test. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The toxicology and autopsy reports do not indicate if Halye had ever used drugs before flying an airplane, but it’s also unknown when Halye was last subjected to a drug test.
