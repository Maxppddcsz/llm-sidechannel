NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH: EXCLUSIVE -- Paula Patton Says Son Julian Takes After His Father Robin Thicke NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paula alleges that Robin has been physically abusive toward their son. \"Over the past year, I have become concerned about [Robin]'s drinking and drug use, as well as the forms of punishment he is using to discipline Julian,” Paula wrote in her declaration. \"My concerns culminated on January 4, 2017, when Julian's school called Department of Child Family Services (DCFS) to report what they believed to be credible allegations of abuse from Julian against [Robin].” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paula goes on to allege that Robin has been spanking Julian excessively. \"We asked him to show us how hard, and I asked him to hit me on my back,” Patton claims, saying she responded with an \"ow.” She adds, \"Julian said it was worse than that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his declaration, Robin says, \"It is my belief that Paula holds residual anger toward me because I and my family would not permit her or her family to attend the funeral of my father on December 20, 2016.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alan Thicke died suddenly on Dec. 13 at the age of 69.
