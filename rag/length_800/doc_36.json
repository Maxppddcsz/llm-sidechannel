(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign rallies have turned into eruptions of barely contained emotions from his impassioned followers, who urge him to fight on despite a series of gut punches that have put his chances of winning in doubt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump stands with female supporters on stage at a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., October 14, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the Nov. 8 election now only weeks away and polls turning against him, Trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What he would do if elected is covered, but much of his speeches are spent belittling his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. He also accuses the U.S. news media of a plot to bring him down, and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opinion polls show a gloomy picture for Trump. A week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women, the latest Reuters-Ipsos poll on Friday showed Clinton up, with 44 percent to Trump’s 37 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero. One woman at a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Thursday wore a homemade T-shirt that said “Trump Can Grab My,” with an arrow pointing to her crotch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday in Greensboro, North Carolina, a man wearing a “Gays for Trump” shirt punched a protester who held up an upside down American flag. Both were ejected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about Clinton, who Trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state. “She would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘SO JADED ALREADY’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up Clinton at an event in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Lock her up!” they chanted, mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump could only smile and shake his head. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “So young and so jaded already,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York businessman feeds off the energy generated by crowds that pack his rallies by the thousands. But he is easily distracted, lurching from topic to topic based on whatever happens to sprint to mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday in Lakeland, Florida, Trump jumped from bashing the news media as “the most dishonest people you’ll ever see,” to tout his performance at a debate in St. Louis on Sunday - “which I won big league” - to Clinton’s stroll across the stage in front of him at that event. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And the papers said I invaded her space,” he said. “Believe me, the last space I want to invade is hers.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are moments of levity. A woman who recovered from a brief fainting spell in the heat of Lakeland was pointed out by Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That woman was out cold and now she is recovered — a little ding to the head,” he said, approvingly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump can form an attack line against Clinton out of pretty much anything that springs to mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Venting about Chinese trade practices before a raucous crowd of perhaps 20,000 in Cincinnati on Thursday night, Trump suddenly imagined how China might treat Clinton given her bout of pneumonia a month ago, which had caused her to nearly collapse at an event in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If she goes down in Tiananmen Square, they’ll just leave her,” he said. “They’re tough people.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s crowds sometimes get agitated.
