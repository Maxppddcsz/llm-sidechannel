    "0": "The anomaly lines up nicely with the object seen in the 1937 Bevington photo and in Jeff Glickman's analysis of the underwater image of the debris field. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The anomaly appears to be the same size and shape of the Electra. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new twist in the search occurred last March when Richard Conroy, a member of TIGHAR's online Amelia Earhart Search Forum, spotted an anomaly in a sonar map posted online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TIGHAR postulates that flood tides lifted the Electra and carried it over the reef edge, leaving behind the landing gear, which was inadvertently photographed by Officer Bevington three months later in October 1937. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers had already identified a small debris field of objects at a depth of 200 feet in the waters of Nikumaroro island, some 300 miles southeast of Earhart's target destination, Howland Island. The site features objects that appear consistent with analysis made by TIGHAR forensic imaging specialist Jeff Glickman of a grainy 1937 photograph of Nikumaroro's western shoreline by British Colonial Service officer Eric R. Bevington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earhart was piloting the Electra, a two-engine plane, in a record attempt to fly around the world at the equator, when she vanished on July 2, 1937. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A grainy sonar image captured off an uninhabited tropical island in the southwestern Pacific republic of Kiribati might represent the remains of the famous aviator's plane, according to The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), which has long been investigating Earhart's last, fateful flight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Submarines will use powerful lights to search a mile-long underwater area down to a depth of more than 3,000 feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for Amelia Earhart's long-lost aircraft will resume next year in the waters off Nikumaroro, an uninhabited island in the southwestern Pacific republic of Kiribati where the legendary pilot may have died as a castaway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starting about the middle of August 2014, the 30-day expedition will be carried out by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), which has long been investigating the last, fateful flight taken by Earhart 76 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Called Niku VIII, the new expedition is expected to cost as much as $3 million. It will rely on two Hawaiian Undersea Research Laboratory (HURL) manned submersibles, Pisces IV and Pisces V, each carrying a pilot and two TIGHAR observers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Play Video The Search For Amelia The search has been going since shortly after she disappeared in 1937. Is it finally over? DCI NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The plan for Niku VIII is built on the hard data gathered and the hard lessons learned during the previous expeditions carried out in 2010 and 2012,” Ric Gillespie, executive director of TIGHAR, said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Equipped with high definition video, still cameras, mechanical arms and recovery baskets, the subs will search a mile-long underwater area down to a depth of more than 3000 feet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Live searching by three people aboard each sub looking at wide vistas illuminated by powerful lights is far superior to searching by looking remotely via the toilet-paper tube view provided by a video camera on an ROV,” Gillespie said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tall, slender, blond pilot mysteriously vanished while flying over the Pacific Ocean on July 2, 1937, during a record attempt to fly around the world at the equator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The general consensus has been that Earhart's twin-engined Lockheed Electra had run out of fuel and crashed in the Pacific Ocean, somewhere near Howland Island. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But TIGHAR researchers believe Amelia suffered a different fate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In nine archaeological expeditions to Nikumaroro, Gillespie and his team uncovered a number of artifacts which, combined with archival research, provide strong circumstantial evidence for a castaway presence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TIGHAR is testing the hypothesis that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan made an emergency landing on the flat coral reef at the western end of Nikumaroro, some 350 miles southeast of their target destination. There, they survived as castaways \"for a matter of weeks, possibly more,\" said Gillespie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She and her navigator Fred Noonan sent radio distress calls from the aircraft for the next five nights before the Electra was washed over the reef edge by rising tides and surf,” Gillespie said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The best evidence for where the plane went into the water is a grainy photograph of the island's western shoreline taken by British Colonial Service officer Eric Bevington three months after Amelia's disappearance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The picture appears to show the wreckage of one of the aircraft’s main land gear assemblies on the reef edge,” Gillespie said. the Fred V, been Laboratory It (TIGHAR), the Amelia expedition in in NEWLINE_CHAR of in as carried miles 1937.
