Massage therapists, athletic trainers, interpreters and others who aren't allowed to write prescriptions apparently issued at least 417,000 under Medicare. (John Moore/Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study released today by the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, identified more than 417,000 such prescriptions paid for by Medicare’s prescription drug program in 2009. The tally included initial prescriptions and refills dispensed by pharmacies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hundreds of thousands of times each year, Medicare pays for prescriptions purportedly written by massage therapists, athletic trainers, interpreters and others who aren’t allowed to prescribe drugs, according to a new federal report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inspector general found nearly 30,000 prescriptions for painkillers and other easily abused drugs that appeared to be prescribed by individuals who had no authority to do so. Such prescribing could “endanger patients” and “may also contribute to the prescription drug abuse problem in our nation,” the report said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cost of all the questionably prescribed drugs came to $31.6 million, according to the study. Although just a small fraction of total drug spending in the program, known as Part D, it raises questions about how closely Medicare tracks the validity of prescriptions or investigates those that appear suspicious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In a prescription drug program like Part D, $31 or $32 million may not sound like a lot, but every little bit adds up,” said Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. “We don’t have the money in Medicare to be wasting for this area.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carper’s panel has scheduled a hearing this afternoon on prescription abuses in the program, which cost the government $62 billion last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report is the second in days in which the inspector general faulted Medicare for its lax oversight of the program. On Thursday, the IG said it had identified more than 700 doctors with highly questionable and potentially dangerous prescribing patterns and called on Medicare to do more to investigate them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was not clear from the new report whether the drugs were actually prescribed by the massage therapists and others or if a pharmacy had mistakenly attributed drugs to them that were legitimately prescribed by others. Another possible explanation is that the prescriptions were fraudulent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inspector general identified prescribers and their specialties using a federal database that includes unique identification numbers, addresses and practice information reported by providers, including their primary specialties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysts tried to exclude those who may have had authority to prescribe drugs despite appearances. For example, someone who identified himself or herself primarily as a dietician also may be a licensed physician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its response to the study, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said some of the examples cited by the report may be due to weaknesses in the federal database relied upon by the inspector general. CMS said it is working to shore up the database, but noted it relies on health professionals to keep their information up-to-date. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even so, the agency said it would ask its fraud contractor to examine the issue and it would investigate the examples found by the inspector general. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have already launched several efforts to address these vulnerabilities, such as an intervention program in an area of high drug abuse and better data analyses to detect patterns of fraud and abuse,” an agency spokesman said in an email to ProPublica. “We agree with the OIG recommendations and are evaluating next steps to continue improving our oversight of Part D.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inspector general’s office said its analysts did not contact providers to ask if they had actually prescribed the drugs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report highlights, but doesn’t name, a Florida dietician as having ordered about 2,600 prescriptions for 165 patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ProPublica used Medicare data it had previously obtained to identify a Florida dietician with a similar tally in 2009, the same year studied by the inspector general. Rocio Garcia, a dietician at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, said she’s never prescribed a drug: “I can’t. I’m not a doctor.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t know what to make of this,” Garcia said. “How could they link my name to [the prescriptions] if I’m not a doctor?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To make sure that payments are accurate, the inspector general said Medicare should require the private insurers that administer Part D to verify that a provider has authority to prescribe drugs before paying for them.
