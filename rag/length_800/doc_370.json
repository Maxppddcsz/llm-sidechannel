NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When she head about the two men who reported the bombs to police, “I was determined to find out their names. I don’t think it’s enough for the media to say ‘two homeless men’ and not put a face on them. What they did is nothing short of being a super hero.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He literally moved that bomb, was there all night with the police and then slept in an abandoned building. We can do better than that,” Bowe said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bowe’s group, which has been twice been recognized by the Clinton Foundation for its projects, made arrangements with the Elizabeth Coalition to House The Homeless to house Parker at The Efficiency Inn until Parker could be situated in a permanent home.

That’s what a hero deserves.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White doesn’t take the “hero” title too seriously. “I don’t call myself that. That’s what other people say. That’s nice, I guess,” White.
