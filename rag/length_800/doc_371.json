    "0": "ATLANTA — With a decisive victory in Georgia, Newt Gingrich saved a campaign that seemed teetering on the precipice of disaster two weeks ago. Polling then suggested that he might achieve no better than a squeaker victory in his home state, an embarrassment that could have led him to withdraw. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But after a single-minded focus on barnstorming around Georgia leading up to the Super Tuesday contests, Mr. Gingrich is poised to gain a substantial share of the state’s 76 delegates to the Republican convention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In the morning, we are going on to Alabama,” Mr. Gingrich told an enthusiastic crowd here on Tuesday night, some waving “Newt-a-Mania” signs. “We’re going on to Mississippi. We’re going on to Kansas. And that’s just this week.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alabama and Mississippi, which hold the next primaries on the calendar next Tuesday, both figure into Mr. Gingrich’s grand strategy for reanimating his candidacy by carrying Super Tuesday momentum into other victories in the South. So does Kansas, which holds its caucuses on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mr. Gingrich failed to gain a strong enough finish in Tennessee and Oklahoma to displace Rick Santorum as the leading alternative to Mitt Romney. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Oklahoma, Mr. Santorum won a commanding victory, with Mr. Romney second and Mr. Gingrich third. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Tennessee, where Mr. Gingrich seemed to have closed some of the gap with Mr. Santorum in recent days, he was on his way to a disappointing third-place finish, exit polling showed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Gingrich lumped Mr. Santorum with all the other candidates who had surged earlier in the campaign only to drop out: Tim Pawlenty, Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Herman Cain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And now it’s Santorum,” Mr. Gingrich said on Tuesday night. “There’s lots of bunny rabbits that run through. I’m the tortoise.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Mr. Gingrich visits Alabama and Mississippi in the next two days, he will be shadowed by Mr. Santorum, who is turning his own sights to the Deep South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Gingrich was feeling confident enough of his Georgia victory on Tuesday to risk another round of “Newt Skywalker” jokes by detouring to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But once out of Georgia, he will not be able to count on the “native son” sentiment that fueled no small part of his win. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to exit polls, more than a third of Georgia voters said Mr. Gingrich’s ties to the state, which he represented in the House for two decades, were important in their choice of candidate. Four out of five voters said the rise in gas prices (up 6 percent in the state in the past month) was an important factor in their choice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Gingrich has focused intensely on energy in the past few weeks, promising to lower the price of gasoline to $2.50 a gallon by aggressive drilling. Many energy economists said the claim was simplistic, and Mr. Romney called it “pandering.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much of Mr. Gingrich’s speech on Tuesday night was spent on a recitation of how “Wall Street” money, meaning Mr. Romney’s wealthy supporters, had been dedicated to undermining his earlier surges with negative advertising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I hope the analysts in Washington and New York, who spent June and July explaining our campaign was dead, will watch this tonight and learn a little bit from this crowd and from this place,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, said Mr. Gingrich had most likely also won support by attacking a favorite target, the “elite” news media, which he took to task for creating a controversy over Rush Limbaugh’s verbal attacks against an advocate for contraception. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Gingrich repeated the criticism on Tuesday, calling the issue over Mr. Limbaugh “the last desperate effort of the elite media to smother an uprising by diverting us into any possible fight.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Black said Mr. Gingrich could win all 14 of Georgia’s Congressional districts, giving him a vast majority of the state’s delegates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s certainly a surprise from what he looked like a couple of weeks ago,” Mr. Black said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even if Mr. Gingrich went on to win the states in play next week, his path to the nomination remains improbable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s got to win something outside the South,” Mr. Black said. “Where’s he going to go? Where’s he going to show strength?” his Mr. majority on Santorum explaining shadowed Tuesday Gingrich on is NEWLINE_CHAR will meaning through.
