    "0": "Company wants to beam your message to aliens NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ever feel that Twitter, Facebook and tumblr just don’t have the reach you were after? That social media is just too, I don’t know … terrestrial? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, a new company says it will start firing your tweet-length messages and more at distant galactic entities starting tomorrow. First up is Gliese 526, a red dwarf star 17.6 light years away. It may or may not have planets but odds are it does, though civilized plants are a whole other matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, the startup project Lone Signal is planning to retrofit the Jamesburg Earth Station radio dish in Carmel, Calif., to beam a steady signal carrying technical data that will identify Earth and show its inhabitants are smart enough to do so in math. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Piggybacking on that main signal will be a secondary one carrying messages from Earthlings. It’s unclear what that will show aliens … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Jamesburg station is currently still listed for sale at $1.5 million, but the real estate company listing it said there is a contract on the station but the deal just hasn’t closed yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Long shot NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Gliese 526 is 17.6 light years from Earth, the messages will be beamed to the coordinates of where the star will be in 17.6 years from now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lone Signal won’t just send out blips of data, the company’s chief science officer, Jacob Haqq-Misra, told The Guardian Express. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It will also continuously transmit content from cultures around the world. The messages that the company will broadcast will be directed toward a different star system roughly once a month. Haqq-Misra explains that radio signals are the fastest and most sufficient delivery method of messages for long distances. He hopes, the Guardian reports, to “inspire a lot of passion in the space sciences and get people thinking about their role in the greater universe.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, of course, the chances of any life sophisticated enough to notice the signal and reply are pretty darn slim. Not to mention that any conversation will take dozens of years between send and receive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happens when aliens answer back? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The broader effort to reach out to aliens is called METI (Messaging to Extraterrestrial Intelligence) or Active SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, not everyone is happy about beaming our address into space where who-knows-what can hear it and send a reactionary squad of murders to check us out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And indeed … the larger issue here is that Haqq-Misra and his colleagues are acting completely unilaterally,” writes io9, a space science journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one has given them permission to do this, nor have they consulted the larger community. In all likelihood, our messages will never reach the ears of an alien civilization ... But it’s the shouting out in the cosmos aspect that’s the real issue here. We simply do not know the risks. Consequently, we should take great care when embarking upon projects such as this. Like Brin has suggested, this should be the part of a much broader conversation, and not some silly exercise intended to make a bit of money.
