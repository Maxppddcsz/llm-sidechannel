NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Genuine visas can only be issued when there is an inside job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fake embassy also reportedly issued visas to other European countries, as well as counterfeit documents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not clear when the criminals were busted but the information was posted on the Department of State’s website on November 2, 2016, the news however, went viral only after ghanabusinessnews.com broke it Friday evening December 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While US Embassy officials won’t comment because they say investigation of the matter is ongoing, ghanabusinessnews.com can say on authority that some staff of the consular section would be fired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A source familiar with Department of State processes told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees found culpable in the crime would simply be recalled and no reasons would be assigned, and Embassy staff wouldn’t even know about it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It appears that’s how diplomatic missions handle offences by staff. Ghanabusinessnews.com is familiar with a similar incident at the Embassy of a European country in Ghana. There was a visa scandal at this Embassy in 2012, and the Ambassador was quietly recalled, and no reason was assigned. Some staff didn’t even know why. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A source who wasn’t authorized to speak to the media told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees at the said Embassy apparently were engaged in illegal issuance of visas, and the travellers were arrested at the country’s entry point. The travellers were caught because that country had joined a new visa system, and had changed its visas. But these travellers had the visa from the old system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an unprecedented move in 2006, Switzerland recalled its entire diplomatic staff including the ambassador from its Karachi mission when it was discovered that there was a massive visa fraud in its Islamabad Embassy, and visas for Pakistanis were halted at that time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fake US Embassy operating somewhere in Accra, was issuing genuine visas, the security team that closed it down said. They also found that a Ghanaian immigration lawyer working with some Turkish and other Ghanaian citizens was involved with the active connivance of Ghana law enforcement officers, who were apparently bribed to look the other way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Visa acquisition in Ghana NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Applying for visas in Ghana is a dreadful experience for any prospective traveller. The consular sections of almost all Embassies demand for proofs like birth certificate, bank statements, invitation letters, some with additional photocopies of hosts, and in some instances even their bank statements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After providing all these, the Embassies demand that prospective travellers submit their applications in person and in most cases go through an interview, and yet many known qualified prospective travellers with no intention of remaining in these countries are denied visas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was a famous case of a medical professional that was invited to present a paper at a conference in Spain but was denied visa on the flimsy excuse that he didn’t satisfy the conditions for a visa, which in most cases means that the applicant is not likely to return to Ghana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This medical expert then responded by writing a copious open letter to the Spanish Embassy in Ghana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Connection men NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Due to the frustrating experience in acquiring a visa to travel, especially to Europe and the US, the phenomena of connection men has sprung up. While anyone familiar with visa issuance processes would disbelieve the effectiveness of these connection men to whom prospective travellers pay huge sums of money for visas, these incidents of the fake US Embassy and the example of the European country’s embassy in Ghana emphatically confirm that insiders work with these connection men to issue visas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Human trafficking NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This fake US Embassy that operated for 10 years, which category of travellers was it serving? Could they have issued visas to human traffickers? Because $6000 is a colossal amount that very few ordinary travellers can afford. It would therefore, not be out of place to assume that most of the clients of this criminal gang were human traffickers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crime of human trafficking is a lucrative illegal business generating an amount of $150 billion every year for traffickers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Emmanuel K.
