(Photo: JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A student gunman opened fire Tuesday at a high school in southern Maryland, injuring two students before an armed school resources officer intervened, authorities said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gunman, identified as Austin Wyatt Rollins, 17, was killed, but St. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron said it was not immediately clear whether the school officer fired the fatal shot or whether the gunman killed himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attack began shortly before classes were scheduled to start at Great Mills High, a 1,500-student school 65 miles south of Washington, D.C. Cameron said Rollins was armed with a Glock, semiautomatic handgun when he shot a 16-year-old female student in a hallway. A 14-year-old male student also was shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our school resource officer was alerted to the events,\" Cameron said. \"He engaged the shooter and fired a round; subsequently the shooter fired a round as well.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cameron said it was not clear whether the gunman shot himself or fired at the resource officer, identified as Deputy First Class Blaine Gaskill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The female student was hospitalized in critical condition, and the male student was in stable condition, Cameron said. Gaskill, who was not injured, followed protocol, Cameron added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is what we prepare for, this is what we pray we will never have to do,\" Cameron said. \"The notion that this can't happen here is no longer a notion.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More: 'We deserve better': Students nationwide walk out NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More: Nikolas Cruz's brother arrested at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cameron said the shooter and the female victim had a prior relationship. Authorities were reviewing social media posts to \"piece together\" a possible motive for the shooting, he said. He asked that no one jump to conclusions until the investigation is concluded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are a very tight-knit community,\" Cameron said. \"So now what I would ask our community to do is pray for the victims.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooting took place less than a week after some Great Mills students joined tens of thousands of students across the nation in a walkout to protest gun violence. The walkout was spearheaded by survivors of the Valentine's Day rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 students and faculty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parkland teens expressed solidarity Tuesday with the students at Great Mills on Twitter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Less than a WEEK ago Great Mills High School students walked out with us to protest gun violence...now they’re experiencing it for themselves,\" tweeted Jaclyn Corin. \"The state of our country is disgusting - I’m so sorry, Great Mills.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tweeted Emma González: \"We are Here for you, students of Great Mills together we can stop this from ever happening again.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooting also took place less than a month after Great Mills High School Principal Jake Heibel told parents that officials had investigated threats of a possible shooting. Law enforcement was contacted, and the threat was \"not validated,\" Heibel told parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, the school was placed on lockdown immediately following the shooting. \"There has been a shooting at Great Mills High School,\" the school district said in a statement on its website. \"The school is on lockdown (and) the event is contained.

The St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office urged parents to gather at another school in the county to reunite with their children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said special agents from Baltimore and Hyattsville joined the investigation. Gov. Larry Hogan said state police were ready to provide support and that his office was monitoring the situation. \"Our prayers are with students, school personnel and first responders,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jill Morris, president of the county education association, called the shooting \"devastating\" for the school's students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are resolved to provide all the support and comfort we can to our colleagues and neighbors ... while we work together toward a day when no school community ever has to experience this type of tragedy,\" she said.
