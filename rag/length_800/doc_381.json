NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve been a proponent of the [second] amendment my entire life,” Caleb Keeter posted on Twitter. “Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Play Video 1:25 Democrats speak out: 'Thoughts and prayers are not enough' – video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the chaotic hours after the attack, which began around 10pm, the members of the Josh Abbott Band were eventually able to post a message on social media, saying that the band and crew were safe.

He said that members of the band’s crew have concealed handgun licenses, and legal firearms on the bus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They were useless,” he said. “We couldn’t touch them for fear police might think that we were part of the massacre and shoot us. A small group (or one man) laid waste to a city with dedicated, fearless police officers desperately trying to help, because of access to an insane amount of firepower. Enough is enough.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keeter said that he spent the harrowing moments of the shooting “writing to my parents and the love of my life a goodbye” – and “a living will because I felt like I wasn’t going to live through the night”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Around him, his friends, bandmates and crew were trapped, under fire. “These rounds were powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in a close proximity of a victim shot by this fucking coward received shrapnel wounds.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The feeling, he wrote, “was enough for me to realize that this is completely and totally out of hand”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We need gun control RIGHT. NOW,” he added. “My biggest regret is that I stubbornly didn’t realize it until my brothers on the road and myself were threatened by it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many country musicians have shied away from politics in recent years, fearing a backlash from fans – as the Dixie Chicks suffered for their opposition to the Iraq war. Exceptions include Lee Greenwood and Toby Keith, who performed at the inauguration of Donald Trump, who has promised to defend gun rights from attempts to regulate firearms. Keith defended the performance, noting that he played events for Republican and Democratic presidents: “I don’t apologize for performing for our country or military.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Rifle Association, the pro-gun lobbying group, has also established an arm called NRA Country that features country music artists, and encourages musicians and fans to “celebrate the lifestyle”. In April, Trump called himself “a true friend and champion” of the lobbying group.
