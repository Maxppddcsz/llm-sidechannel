NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Music plagiarism is big news in almost any era. Sure, Robin Thicke and Pharrell had to shell out $7 million to Marvin Gaye's estate for their \"Blurred Lines\" infringement and there was the whole Tom Petty/Sam Smith debacle in recent music history, but singers have been ripping off other people's songs since recorded music first came on the scene, and even before that. What are the most blatant ripoff songs, which obviously stole music, lyrics, or both from other tracks? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chances are, your favorite band has either intentionally or purposefully stolen someone else's lyrics or melody - and probably had it done to them as well. While some plagiarism cases are extremely well known (George Harrison stealing the melody of \"He's So Fine,\" or John Fogerty being sued for plagiarizing himself, for example) there are almost limitless examples of songs being plagiarized. Some were successful, others got slapped down with huge judgements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These blatant cases of musical plagiarism cross genres, decades, and styles, showing that musicians stealing from each other is no rarity. Is your favorite song a rip off of another famous musician? Find out in the list below! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1 + - 36 2 \"Ice Ice Baby\" by Vanilla Ice vs. \"Under Pressure\" by Queen NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps the most blatant ripoff on this list, Vanilla Ice was sued by Queen and David Bowie for stealing their riff from \"Under Pressure\" in his 1989 hit \"Ice Ice Baby.\" Although Vanilla Ice's song was the first hip-hop song to top the Billboard charts, the legacy of the song is tarnished by the stolen sample. All four members of Queen and David Bowie were later credited for the riff, and were compensated with both money and a writing credit for the song. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's \"Ice Ice Baby\": NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And now listen to \"Under Pressure\"; you'll have no trouble spotting the similarities: ï»¿ 18 Times Taylor Swift Was Totally Country NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2 + - 16 1 \"Live While We're Young\" by One Direction vs. \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" by The Clash NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another \"homage\" to classic rock by One Direction, \"Live While We're Young\" steals the iconic opening chords to The Clash's classic \"Should I Stay Or Should I Go.\" Like the band's earlier pilfering of \"Baba O'Riley,\" it serves to draw the ear of older listeners while not being extensive enough to merit a plagiarism claim. Well played, boys. Well played. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's \"Live While We're Young\": And The Clash performing \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\": NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3 + - 14 1 \"Dazed and Confused\" by Led Zeppelin vs. \"Dazed and Confused\" by Jake Holmes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One could write an entire list just of Led Zeppelin's alleged and confirmed thefts. But maybe the most blatant was in the case of \"Dazed and Confused.\" As the story goes, folk singer Jake Holmes wrote the song in 1967, whereby it was soon covered by The Yardbirds, for whom Holmes was opening. The Yardbirds, in their death throes, at that time featured future Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Page liked the song so much he brought it to the sessions for Led Zeppelin's first album - albeit with new lyrics (based, in turn, on a different set of lyrics for the song, written by The Yardbirds singer Keith Relf) and a slightly altered melody. The song's arrangement remained the same. Page credited himself as the song's sole writer, and blew Holmes off when Holmes attempted to contact him a few years later. In essence, Page had stolen a hit song and ensured the original writer wouldn't get a nickel out of it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, in 2010, Jake Holmes sued Jimmy Page, with the two parties settling out of court. Even now, the song is credited only to Page, with \"inspiration\" by Holmes.
