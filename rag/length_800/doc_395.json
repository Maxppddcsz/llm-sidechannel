But the Ahmed Baba centre in the Malian city of Timbuktu is not the kind of library that would accept visitors after dark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Islamist militants tricked the guard and said they were coming to secure the place. But once inside, they ransacked the centre's reading room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When historian Abdoulaye Cisse arrived early in the morning, the pile of ashes was still warm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They probably spent most of the night in there,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of empty handcrafted boxes still litter the floor of the hallway. Ashes haven't been removed yet either. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few people come in and out surveying the irreparable damage and lament the remains of a cultural trove kept in Timbuktu for centuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's a huge wealth that will be impossible to replace Abdoulaye Cisse, Historian Treasure trove of African history NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 2,000 manuscripts were stored in this centre that was opened in 2009, funded by the South African government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The project was meant to catalogue and preserve the city's historical documents, many of which continue to be held by families or smaller libraries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another 28,000 were due to be transferred to the Ahmed Baba premises but were instead sent to the capital after al-Qaeda militants arrived in the city last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each box is tagged with a reference number and if the search is properly done, these tags should reveal the full extent of the damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It could also reveal how many were simply stolen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These fighters know too well how much these papers are valued, it's a huge wealth that will be impossible to replace,\" Mr Cisse told the BBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image caption The Institute's manuscripts date back to the 13th century (file image) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When I surveyed the reading room, I found about 30 left so I brought them home to secure them,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The offending texts ranged from history to geography and astronomy, medicine and Islamic law; writings dating back in some cases as far as the 13th Century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the reading room, shelves were emptied and the desk equipped with a magnifying glass vandalised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Named after a saint of the ancient city who wrote many manuscripts himself, the Ahmed Baba centre stands out for its modernity but was designed to echo the famous Timbuktu style of dry-mud walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Islamist militants prepared to flee last week knowing that an assault by the French-led forces on their positions here was imminent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in their haste, they took the time to commit one last act of vengeance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They had sparked worldwide condemnation last year when they destroyed sacred tombs and shrines designated as Unesco World Heritage sites on the pretext that they violated principles of Islamic law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Treasures of Timbuktu Timbuktu was a centre of Islamic learning from the 13th to the 17th Centuries NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 700,000 manuscripts had survived in public libraries and private collections NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Books on religion, law, literature and science NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Added to Unesco world heritage list in 1988 for its three mosques and 16 cemeteries and mausoleums NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They played a major role in spreading Islam in West Africa; the oldest dates from 1329 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Islamists destroyed mausoleums after seizing the city Why do we know Timbuktu? In pictures: Timbuktu manuscripts NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elhadj Djitteye, who used to guide visitors in town, reckons that the fighters linked to al-Qaeda carried out the attack on the library in response to the French military intervention ordered earlier in January by President Francois Hollande. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Noting that the jihadis hadn't touched the manuscripts in 10 months of occupation, Mr Djitteye sadly comments that they \"hit Timbuktu straight at its heart\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The militants' destructive parting gesture left many residents feeling that another part of their celebrated city's history had just been erased. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people of Timbuktu have been anxious to return to some kind of normal life since the French and Malian troops entered they city and were hailed as \"liberators\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reminders of the extremists, like the black banners proclaiming sharia at the city gates, are being removed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in just under a year, the Islamist militants have inflicted lasting damage on Mali's most renowned cultural centre. The scars left by Timbuktu's occupation are likely to take much longer to heal. on last damage ransacked a night jihadis last of Baba last NEWLINE_CHAR as NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR how last coming",
