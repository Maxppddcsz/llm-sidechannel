NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis Unlike mainland China, transport accidents resulting in fatalities are extremely rare in Hong Kong. This city of more than seven million people prides itself on highly regulated, efficient forms of mass transport by road, underground and by sea. Hong Kong was founded as a deep-water port more than 150 years ago. Its surrounding waters are home to some of the busiest shipping routes in the world. Its location close to the Pearl River Delta means vessels carrying cargo ply those waters everyday. In addition to the commercial ships, leisure and fishing boats are common sights, but serious collisions are uncommon. Thousands of people take regularly scheduled ferries from Hong Kong's main islands to outlying territories such as Lamma Island, which is a very popular area for both tourists and residents.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crash is Hong Kong's worst maritime accident since 1971, when a ferry sank during a typhoon, leaving 88 people dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It occurred during a busy period for passenger travel, at the end of a long holiday weekend to mark the mid-autumn festival that this year coincided with China's National Day on 1 October.
