Moved by the story, some 14,000 donors gave over $400,000 to rescue the man from homelessness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As it turns out, it was all a lie.

Unfortunately it was,” Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said during a news conference on Thursday, adding that the trio “hoodwinked” the donors. “The entire campaign was predicated on a lie.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McClure did not run out of gas on a Philadelphia ramp that night and Bobbitt did not spend his last $20 to help her. According to Coffina, McClure texted a friend right after setting up the GoFundMe, writing, “The gas part is completely made up, but the guy isn’t. I had to make something up to make people feel bad.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In reality, the group initially met at an off-ramp near a casino in Philadelphia they frequented a month before they launched their campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The evidence developed over the course of this investigation demonstrates that D’Amico and McClure had known Bobbitt for at least a month or more prior to the date of the GoFundMe ‘Paying it Forward’ campaign’s launch, as they had met him on their frequent trips to a local gambling casino,” according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BCPO NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The heartwarming tale convinced thousands of people to donate to the group’s GoFundMe to get Bobbitt off the streets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Coffina announced that the trio have all been charged with second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception. D’Amico and McClure turned themselves in to the prosecutor’s office on Wednesday and Bobbitt was taken into custody in Philadelphia, he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their plan worked. After fees, donations amounted to more than $367,000, all of which was deposited into D’Amico’s accounts. The couple gave Bobbitt $75,000 of the money, according to Coffina. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But he wanted his fair share of the take,” the prosecutor added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Swanson /The Philadelphia Inquirer/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, Bobbitt accused the couple of withholding the money, with his attorneys filing a civil suit in August on his behalf in an attempt to get the remaining funds. But by then the money was long gone. Coffina said on Thursday that D’Amico and McClure had “squandered” the money by mid-March — about five months after setting up the GoFundMe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coffina said the trio would have likely gotten away with their scam had Bobbitt not wanted more money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the funds dwindled, D’Amico boasted about a book deal the couple had been pursuing. They planned to call it No Good Deed. The couple was even unfazed by Bobbitt’s efforts, planning to move forward with their book plan despite his accusations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “[Bobbitt] deserves our appreciate for his willingness to serve our country as a United States Marine and he has our sympathy and concern for the homelessness he has experienced as well as his publicized struggle with addiction,” Coffina said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Coffina said the plan was a group effort, he mentioned that Bobbitt shared a “remarkably similar” story on his Facebook account.
