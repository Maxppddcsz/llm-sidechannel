A rep for Corinne Olympios released the following statement about Bachelor in Paradise to Bustle: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4.

As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: On the evening of Wednesday, June 14, Jackson released a statement about Olympios' allegations to E!

The safety, security and well-being of the cast and crew is our number one concern, and we suspended filming so that the allegations could be investigated immediately and thoroughly. Our internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed. Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident. We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy. Production on this season of Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show’s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update #3: On Tuesday, Corinne Olympios' lawyer Martin Singer released a statement to Bustle that read, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It needs to be made crystal clear that production of 'Bachelor in Paradise' was shut down because of multiple complaints received from 'BIP' producers and crew members on the set.
