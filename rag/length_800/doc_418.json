NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But there's one thing Lafferty's ad-hoc gumshoes have that most of the others don't. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They have badges. Retirees' badges - but badges nonetheless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the nation, at least a dozen law enforcement officials - both active and retired -have taken it upon themselves to try to solve the mystery of the killer who fatally shot or stabbed five people in the Bay Area in 1968 and 1969 and sent almost two dozen taunting letters stuffed with cryptograms to individuals and newspapers, including The Chronicle, until 1974. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They pore over the ciphers and come up with translations they say lead to everyone from an already convicted serial slayer from Kentucky to a Southern California officer's father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Official investigators in Napa County, Vallejo and San Francisco - the Zodiac's killing zones - usually have a few choice words for the amateur tipsters who contact them each at a clip of at least a half-dozen a week. Among the more common labels: kooks, publicity-hunters and liars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Law enforcement tips NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when it's a cop giving the clues - well, that's something different. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lafferty and another of his sleuthing crew, for instance, used to be California Highway Patrol officers. Another member of the team was a police detective, and yet another was a naval intelligence officer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are so many crackpots and theories, but we take the ones that come in from ex- or current law enforcement a little more seriously,\" said Pat McMahon, a detective with the sheriff's office in Napa County, where the Zodiac stabbed two people, one fatally, in 1969. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said it's not surprising that others in law enforcement would take an interest in the Zodiac. After Jack the Ripper, it's probably the most infamous unsolved murder case in history - and police are drawn to unsolved mysteries like cats to catnip, McMahon said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're just that kind of people,\" he said. \"We're nosy, and we want to know the unknowable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wide gamut NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among those nosy people is Chicago police Lt. John Lewison, who contacted the FBI in the spring to say he'd cracked enough of the Zodiac's cryptic messages to discern the killer's initials. He's not revealing them publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are also former Colma Police Chief Raymond Ottoboni, who contends that the Zodiac killed at Lake Tahoe, former Los Angeles police Detective Steve Hodel, who fingers his own father as the Zodiac, and Dr. John Averitt, a police psychologist in Cookeville, Tenn., who just released an online documentary re-exploring old theories of the Zodiac's involvement in a pair of killings in Santa Barbara. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some send thick packets to media outlets and investigators, such as retired police Detective John Cameron of Great Falls, Mont., who says the Zodiac is convicted quintuple-murderer Edward Edwards of Kentucky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"His handwriting matches up, the clues match up, and I believe he killed about 118 people,\" Cameron said. Edwards died in April in Ohio, three months before he was to be executed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No smoking gun NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Napa detective McMahon said his department has looked into several of these theories, including Cameron's, \"but my problem is the smoking gun is not there yet on any of these.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lafferty's crew is apparently the biggest yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 78-year-old retired CHP officer and two of his fellow sleuths - ex-Vallejo police Detective James Dean and former Navy intelligence officer Jerry Johnson - worked on the Zodiac case while on active duty. The rest of his team includes another ex-CHP officer, a minister and a local historian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Look, I know what most people think of Zodiac theories, and there have been so many over the years that if a person walked into the Vallejo Police Department right now and said he was the Zodiac, they'd tell him to get out,\" Lafferty said. \"But I do feel that we have a very credible case.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the Zodiac is an elderly alcoholic living in Fairfield who was motivated to kill by jealousy over his wife's affair with a prominent local man. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Man driven by rage NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lafferty dragged himself into the Zodiac zeitgeist in August 1970, nine months after the last confirmed killing, when he became suspicious of a man parking at Vallejo highway rest stops.
