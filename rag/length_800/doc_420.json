Do your kids use raw dough to make ornaments or homemade “play” clay? Do you eat at family restaurants that give kids raw dough to play with while you’re waiting for the food? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If your answer to any of those questions is yes, that could be a problem. Eating raw dough or batter—whether it’s for bread, cookies, pizza or tortillas—could make you, and your kids, sick, says Jenny Scott, a senior advisor in FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Scott, the bottom line for you and your kids is don’t eat raw dough. And even though there are websites devoted to “flour crafts,” don’t give your kids raw dough or baking mixes that contain flour to play with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why? Flour, regardless of the brand, can contain bacteria that cause disease. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local officials, investigated an outbreak of infections that illustrated the dangers of eating raw dough. Dozens of people across the country were sickened by a strain of bacteria called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O121. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation found that raw dough eaten or handled by some of the patients was made with flour found in subsequent tests by the FDA to have the same bacterium that was making people sick. Ten million pounds of flour were recalled, including unbleached, all-purpose, and self-rising varieties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of the recalled flours had been sold to restaurants that allow children to play with dough made from the raw flour while waiting for their meals. CDC advises restaurants not to give customers raw dough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why Flour? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People often understand the dangers of eating raw dough due to the presence of raw eggs and the associated risk with Salmonella. However, consumers should be aware that there are additional risks associated with the consumption of raw dough, such as particularly harmful strains of E. coli in a product like flour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Flour is derived from a grain that comes directly from the field and typically is not treated to kill bacteria,” says Leslie Smoot, Ph.D., a senior advisor in FDA’s Office of Food Safety and a specialist in the microbiological safety of processed foods. So if an animal heeds the call of nature in the field, bacteria from the animal waste could contaminate the grain, which is then harvested and milled into flour. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Common “kill steps” applied during food preparation and/or processing (so-called because they kill bacteria that cause infections) include boiling, baking, roasting, microwaving, and frying. But with raw dough, no kill step has been used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And don’t make homemade cookie dough ice cream either. If that’s your favorite flavor, buy commercially made products. Manufacturers should use ingredients that include treated flour and pasteurized eggs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Symptoms and Who Gets Sick NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Common symptoms for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli are diarrhea (often bloody) and abdominal cramps, although most people recover within a week. But some illnesses last longer and can be more severe, resulting in a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS can occur in people of any age, but is most common in young children under 5 years, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parents of young children should be particularly aware. For instance, if your child is in day care or kindergarten, a common pastime may be art using “play” clay that is homemade from raw dough. Even if they’re not munching on the dough, they’re putting their hands in their mouth after handling the dough. Childcare facilities and preschools should discourage the practice of playing with raw dough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Handle Foods Safely NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FDA offers these tips for safe food handling to keep you and your family healthy: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do not eat any raw cookie dough, cake mix, batter, or any other raw dough or batter product that is supposed to be cooked or baked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow package directions for cooking products containing flour at proper temperatures and for specified times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wash hands, work surfaces, and utensils thoroughly after contact with flour and raw dough products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keep raw foods separate from other foods while preparing them to prevent any contamination that may be present from spreading. Be aware that flour may spread easily due to its powdery nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow label directions to chill products containing raw dough promptly after purchase until baked.
