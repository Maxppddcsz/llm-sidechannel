    "0": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The day after learning that Michelle Knight was one of three women rescued from a decade of captivity in a Seymour Avenue home, her mother said she hopes her now 32-year-old daughter will be able to resume her interrupted life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Contacted by phone at her home in Florida, Barbara Knight said she has had limited contact with Cleveland police since the news broke Monday night and is still relying on media reports for updates on her daughter's condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And she said she finds it hard to believe that the woman discovered in the home of suspect Ariel Castro, 52, is really Michelle, having had her hopes dashed in the past by false reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barbara Knight said she hopes she and her daughter will reunite -- and that she can atone for the role she played in her daughter's troubled life leading up to her disappearance on Aug. 23, 2002. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michelle Knight lived most of her life on the city's West Side, with many of her happiest childhood days spent in a house on West 60th Street, her mother said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There, she helped her mother work in her vegetable garden and loved to feed apples to the neighbor's pet pony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michelle became fascinated with the fire engines that occasionally raced down her street en route to emergencies, and after a tour of the local fire station, set her heart on one day becoming a firefighter herself, her mother said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Michelle loved animals too, and after she helped her mother deliver the family Shih Tzu's litter of puppies, she decided that becoming a veterinarian might be a better fit, Barbara Knight recalled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michelle had many friends and seemed to enjoy school, especially art class, where she developed a talent for sketching, Knight said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But trouble began when Michelle was 17 years old and told her mother that she had been the victim of an assault at school. Knight said her daughter reported the incident to police but felt that her story was not taken seriously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon afterward, Knight became pregnant and decided to drop out of school. She dreamed of eventually completing her education to provide her son a better life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Barbara Knight said that among her own greatest regrets was becoming involved with an abusive man, whom, she believes, injured her toddler grandson -- spurring a chain of events that led Michelle to lose custody of the child. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She vanished not long afterward, on a day when she was scheduled for a court appearance in the custody case, Barbara Knight said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Cleveland police's missing-person report detailing Michelle Knight's disappearance is brief, stating that she had a mental condition and frequently was confused by her surroundings. She was last seen at a cousin's house near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue, the report states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also noted that she answers to the nickname \"Shorty.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But apart from those notations, Barbara Knight said, police did little to investigate the disappearance and theorized that Michelle likely left of her own accord, embittered by the custody battle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Knight said that wasn't her daughter's nature. So she papered Cleveland's West Side with fliers, and even after moving out of state, would often return to continue the search on her own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Knight said she believes she once saw her daughter walking with an older man at a shopping plaza on West 117th Street several years ago. When the woman trailed behind her companion, he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her along, Knight said. She said that she yelled Michelle's name, but the woman did not turn around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR City officials reported Monday that Michelle Knight -- along with the other captive women, Gina DeJesus, 23, and Amanda Berry, 27 -- have been discharged from the hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Barbara Knight and a cousin said they are frustrated by a lack of information from city police. They said they have yet to be told where Michelle was taken after leaving the hospital and when they can see her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Knight also said she gave police a photo of her daughter when she filed the missing-persons report years ago and is disheartened that it has not appeared in media accounts alongside those of Berry and DeJesus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The family has no other photo of Michelle to provide to the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Knight said she hopes to hear her daughter's voice soon, and that Michelle might consider joining her in Florida to start her life anew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I really miss her,\" Knight said. \"She was my daughter, but she",
