NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The entire inebriated episode was caught on camera. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just after accepting a proposal to marry his partner and downing three whiskeys, a slurring Kerr is seen disregarding the commands to all passengers by a flight attendant to remain buckled in their seats before deplaning at Charlotte Douglas International Airport at 10:21 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the American Eagle Flight 5039 jet wheeled slowly toward Gate E3, according to the federal complaint filed in the Western District of North Carolina, a stumbling Kerr wobbled down the aisle and demanded VIP treatment to exit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the aircraft’s doors still locked shut, Kerr was rebuffed and “threatened” the flight attendant “by saying that he would break [her] jaw,” the complaint claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A video that was published on the Charlotte Observer’s website shows Kerr, with his dark, furry sideburned chops sporting a backward black baseball cap, black T-shirt, low riding jeans, and slinging a backpack off his left shoulder jousting with the pilot, who is only referred to as “N.B.” in the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I said take a seat, sir,” the pilot sternly orders Kerr. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Noooooooo,” the liquored up 36-year-old chef from Lexington told him. “I doooon’t want to take a seat—” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t care what you want to do, you’re going to take a seat right now,” the pilot shot back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video cuts to Kerr getting physical with the flight attendant who is trying to stop him from exiting plane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Uh-huh—you’re going to let me by,” Kerr said again, while sandwiched by the flight attendant and swaying in front of the captain.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the document Kerr was “verbally abusive to the flight crew” and “cursed at them” because he refused to return to his seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he was told to go back he then became belligerent with a second flight attendant with the initials “F.L.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Kerr kicked [F.L.] in the right lower leg and then shoved [F.L.] to the floor of the plane,” the feds claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flight attendant in the middle of the melee complained she had experienced “an injury to the left upper arm” when she was allegedly brought to the floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After more arguing, Kerr tries to bolt past the flight attendant and knocks her over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s when pilot “N.B.” and co-pilot “J.R.” restrained him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sit down. Sit down. Enough,” the pilot says as he gets Kerr down on the floor of the aisle. “You don’t put your hands on my flight attendant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Enough. You hear me?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerr started flailing before he ultimately surrendered when quick-thinking passengers restrained him with their seatbelts, according to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Whatever you do is going on Facebook,” Kerr screamed “And you are in complete losers. Yeah! You heard me right the first time.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerr worked as a chef at a high-end eatery called Portofino and was about to tie the knot with his partner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Facebook—just days after the event—the axed chef acted like nothing happened, posting about his future nuptials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On July 23, Kerr posted: “Got Engaged to Matthew Stacy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whatever happened on the plane clearly didn’t undo Kerr’s romantic life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When a friend offered his Justice of the Peace duties to the engaged couple, Kerr chimes in: “no offense. We have to discuss that…” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That may be because he is now facing federal charges for interference with the performance or duties of a flight crewmember or flight attendant. The assault could leave his future groom at the altar if he is convicted, as Kerr could serve as many as 20 years prison and be fined up to $250,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An American Airlines spokeswoman confirmed there was “a disruptive passenger” on board one of their flights but referred all questions to the feds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, Kerr was released on $25,000",
