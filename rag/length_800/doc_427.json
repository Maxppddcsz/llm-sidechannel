(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 15,000 people took part in more than two dozen protests across Kashmir, chanting `'Down with America\" and `'Down with Israel\" in some of the largest anti-American demonstrations against the film in Asia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The low-budget film \"Innocence of Muslims\" produced by a filmmaker in the United States ridicules Islam and depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer and a madman.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to the statement, U.S. Embassy officials sent out a message reiterating its call for citizens to stay away from Kashmir, a volatile territory where many oppose India's rule. Police said they were investigating the cleric's statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though many local separatists groups disavowed the threat to Americans, local authorities put five top separatist leaders under house arrest, a common action when protests or violence is expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jamat-e-Islami, Kashmir's biggest Islamic party, demanded the U.S. government crack down on the filmmakers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If America is true in its claim of being against any kind of religious blasphemy, then it should lose no time in taking stern action against these enemies of humanity,\" a statement from the party said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, about 200 protesters in Jakarta chanted slogans and held up signs in a largely peaceful protest outside the heavily guarded U.S. Embassy. American diplomatic outposts increased security worldwide this week after clips of the film went viral online and sparked violent protests in the Middle East. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We came here because we want the U.S. to punish whoever was involved with the film,\" protester Abdul Jabar Umam said. \"They should know that we are willing to die to defend the honor of our Prophet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 20 protesters outside the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, shouted \"Allahu akbar!\" and handed reporters a letter addressed to the U.S. ambassador expressing their anger over the movie and calling for greater respect for religions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indonesia's government has been working to block access to clips of the film online, and a prominent cleric has urged calm. But others are calling for Muslims worldwide to defend the dignity of the Prophet Muhammad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, a branch of the international network that advocates a worldwide Islamic state and the ones who organized the protest, on its website blamed the U.S. government for allowing the film to be produced and released, calling it \"an act of barbarism that cannot go unpunished.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Why do these people seek problems by disturbing our peace? They knew the risk they were facing by angering people,\" said Muhammad Al-Khaththath,",
