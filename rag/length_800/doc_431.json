    "0": "Financial security continued to charge ahead in June with Americans noting improvement in several aspects of their personal finances, according to a monthly reading by Bankrate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bankrate’s Financial Security Index rose 3 percent compared with the same period last year, and it remained in positive territory for the 13th straight month. The index, which is based on a national telephone survey, showed improving feelings among Americans about job security, net worth, comfort level with debt and overall financial situation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The index peaked in February, reaching the highest level in its five-year history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only weakness in the June survey came when people were asked about their savings. Americans have indicated a heightened concern about their savings since the Financial Security Index began, and that continued this month. Those concerns are easing, however. In 2011, Americans were more than twice as likely to say that they were less comfortable with their savings than more comfortable. The gap has narrowed this year, and the difference is now within the margin of error. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Princeton Survey Research Associates International conducts the survey that accompanies the index. This month’s survey was taken from June 4 to 7 with 1,000 adults living in the continental U.S. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
