For years the building in the Austrian town of Braunau am Inn has been rented by the Austrian interior ministry to prevent misuse by neo-Nazis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was once a day-care centre for the disabled. Now it is empty, as the owner has not agreed to any plans for its future use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Braunau am Inn is a pretty little town in northern Austria, right on the border with Germany. But it has a heavy legacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just off the main square is Salzburger Vorstadt 15: a solid, 17th-Century former inn, where Adolf Hitler was born in 1889. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hitler's family, who rented rooms upstairs, was not originally from Braunau. His father Alois, had been posted there for his job as a customs official. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Adolf Hitler only lived in Salzburger Vorstadt 15 for a few weeks, before his family moved to another address in Braunau. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They left the town for good when Hitler was three years old. He returned briefly to Braunau in 1938, on his way to Vienna, after he annexed Austria to Nazi Germany.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I've even witnessed people from Italy or from France coming here… for adoration purposes,\" Josef Kogler, a teacher in Braunau, said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One Frenchman, a history teacher I think it was, came and asked me for Hitler's birthplace… It's hard to understand.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These days, the house is locked up and empty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Austrian interior ministry was so concerned about the possibility of neo-Nazis using the building as a site of pilgrimage that, since 1972, it has rented it from the owner, Gerlinde Pommer, to prevent any misuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mrs Pommer currently receives almost €5,000 (£3,925; $6,140) a month, according to town officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For many years, the house was used as a day-care centre for people with special needs. But in 2011, they had to move out.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She does not accept any proposal of using the house for offices or other purposes,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She does not allow any changing of the house, so you can't rebuild any rooms, you can't build modern bathrooms or put in a lift. It is difficult.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the past three years, various proposals have been put forward about how to use the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These include turning it into flats, a centre for adult education, a museum or a centre of responsibility, for confronting the Nazi past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One Russian MP even offered to buy the house and blow it up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright BBC / Bethany Bell Image caption Historian Florian Kotanko says Austrians have learned to speak frankly of their past NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With no agreement in sight, the interior ministry recently appealed to all the other federal and regional government ministries to help decide what to do with the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Braunau's deputy mayor, Guenter Pointner of the Social Democrats, says the ministry is now considering terminating the rental contract with Mrs Pommer. She was not available for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The row over the house has stirred up uncomfortable memories for the prosperous little town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some, including Braunau's second deputy mayor Christian Schilcher of the far-right Freedom Party, think it is time to move on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people are fed up,\" he said. \"This theme is a problem for the image of Braunau. We want to be a beautiful little town, with tourism and visitors. We are not the children of Hitler.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright BBC / Bethany Bell Image caption A stone plaque outside Hitler's birthplace honours the victims of fascism NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But others, including Florian Kotanko, say ignoring history makes things worse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You have the connection with Braunau and Hitler even without the house,\" he said. \"Everyone can read that Hitler was born here.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Braunau now has plans to put up an exhibit about the house and the links with Hitler in the local museum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For many years, Austrians and the people of Braunau were reluctant to discuss the Nazi past, but Florian Kotanko says that is changing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Once",
