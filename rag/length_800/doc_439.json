NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials told Reuters the medium-range missiles appeared to be fired from road-mobile launchers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One missile, fired from north of the capital, Pyongyang, flew across the peninsula and into the sea off the east coast early Friday morning, South Korea’s Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That would mark North Korea’s first test of a medium-range missile, one of which was capable of reaching Japan, since 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the second missile flew a short period before exploding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR South Korea did not confirm the type of missile but U.S. officials said they were medium-range ballistic missiles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A range of 800 km was likely beyond the capability of most short-range missiles in North Korea’s arsenal. The North’s Rodong missile has an estimated maximum range of 1,300 km (810 miles), according to the South’s defense ministry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea’s action provoked a barrage of criticism and appeals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang urged it to abide by U.N. resolutions and not do anything to exacerbate tensions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the United States was “analyzing the results of those launches,” but called on Beijing to use its influence over Pyongyang. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “China could do a lot more,” Carter said, adding Beijing should seek a nuclear-free North Korea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. State Department in a statement urged North Korea to focus on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments and obligations.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Japan strongly demands North Korea to exercise self-restraint and will take all necessary measures, such as warning and surveillance activity, to be able to respond to any situations,” Abe said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NUCLEAR WARHEADS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Slideshow (3 Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea often fires missiles during periods of tension on the Korean peninsula or when it comes under pressure to curb its defiance and abandon its weapons programs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, the North fired two short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast and its leader Kim Jong Un ordered more nuclear weapons tests and missile tests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That came after North Korean media said the North had miniaturized nuclear warheads to fit on ballistic missiles and quoted Kim as calling on the military to prepare for a “pre-emptive nuclear strike” against the United States and South Korea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. President Barack Obama imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Wednesday over its nuclear test and satellite launch. The sanctions freeze North Korean government assets in the United States, bans U.S. exports to, or investment in, North Korea, and expands a U.S. blacklist to anyone, including non-Americans, who deals with North Korea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and launched a long-range rocket on Feb. 7 in defiance of existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North has called annual joint drills by U.S. and South Korean troops that began on March 7 “nuclear war moves” and threatened to wipe out its enemies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. and South Korea remain technically at war with the North because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armed truce instead of a peace agreement. In recent weeks, the two Koreas have suspended economic ties over the mounting tensions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR South Korea and U.S. officials this month began discussions on deploying the advanced anti-missile Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system to the U.S. military in the South, despite Chinese and Russian objections.
