NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sarin attack, Japan's worst terror incident, killed 13 people and injured thousands more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The executions took place at a Tokyo detention house on Friday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan does not give prior notice of executions, but they were later confirmed by the justice ministry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shoko Asahara, 63, and his followers were also accused of several other murders and an earlier Sarin gas attack in 1994 which killed eight and left 600 injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their execution, by hanging, had been postponed until all those convicted had completed their final appeals. That happened in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another six members of the cult are still on death row. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Injured victims and the families of those killed have welcomed the executions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I reacted calmly... But I did feel the world had become slightly brighter,\" said Atsushi Sakahara, a film director who was caught in the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be impossible to ever forget the incident, but the execution brings a kind of closure.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What was the Tokyo attack? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On 20 March 1995, cult members released the Sarin on the subway in the Japanese capital. They left punctured bags filled with liquid nerve agent on train lines going through Tokyo's political district. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses described noticing the leaking packages and soon afterwards feeling stinging fumes hitting their eyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The toxin struck victims down in a matter of seconds, leaving them choking and vomiting, some blinded and paralysed. Thirteen people died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aum Shinrikyo, often shortened to Aum, believed that the end of the world was coming and that those outside the cult would go to hell - unless they were killed by cult members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cult leader Asahara styled the attack as a \"holy attempt to elevate the doomed souls of this world to a higher spiritual stage\", the Japan Times reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the months after, members of the cult made several failed attempts to release hydrogen cyanide in various stations.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scores of Aum members have faced trial over the incident and 13 were sentenced to death, including Asahara. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another six are serving life sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is the Aum Shinrikyo cult? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cult, whose name means \"supreme truth\", began in the 1980s as a spiritual group mixing Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, later working in elements of apocalyptic Christian prophesies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shoko Asahara, also known as Chizuo Matsumoto, declared himself to be both Christ and the first \"enlightened one\" since Buddha. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright AFP Image caption Aum Shinrikyo is believed to still have thousands of followers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aum Shinrikyo gained official status as a religious organisation in Japan in 1989 and picked up a sizeable global following. At its peak, Asahara had tens of thousands of followers worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group gradually became a paranoid doomsday cult, convinced the world was about to end in a global war and that only they would survive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cult went underground after the 1995 attack, but did not disappear, eventually renaming itself Aleph or Hikari no Wa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aum Shinrikyo is designated a terrorist organisation in the US and many other countries, but Aleph and Hikari no Wa are both legal in Japan, although designated as \"dangerous religions\" subject to surveillance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It still has followers both in Japan and also worldwide, in particular in some countries of the former Soviet Union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2016, police in Russia conducted a number of raids on suspected cult members in Moscow and St Petersburg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How has the execution gone down in Japan? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shizue Takahashi, the widow of a subway worker killed in the attack, said she felt Asahara's execution was fitting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He of course deserves death,\" she told reporters. \"The execution was processed as it should be... so no tears for me at all.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Japan has executed as many as eight people a year since an effective moratorium ended in 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The death penalty is only used for serious cases of murder. Officials do not give advance public notice of executions, and those condemned usually learn they are scheduled to die just a few hours beforehand. been ministry. the NEWLINE_CHAR AFP to",
