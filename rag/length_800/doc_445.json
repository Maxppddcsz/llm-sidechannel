    "0": "A coalition of protest groups planned to rally against Donald Trump outside Rockefeller Center on Saturday night, denouncing Saturday Night Live for featuring the presidential candidate. One group, meanwhile, offered a “bounty” to anyone who would disrupt the taping live from New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re hoping that somebody in the audience stands up and calls him a racist,” Luke Montgomery, the organizer of a political action committee behind the bounty, told the Guardian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protest groups unaffiliated with Montgomery’s Pac have banded together after the comedy show booked Trump as host, protesting at a Trump tower and at NBC headquarters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The billionaire, reality television personality and Republican White House hopeful provoked outrage with a June speech that accused Mexican immigrants of “bringing crime, they’re rapists”. He has nevertheless dominated the polls for months, exasperating GOP leaders and Hispanic Americans alike with his plan to deport 11 million people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several networks, including SNL’s parent, NBC Universal, severed ties with billionaire over the remarks. Pro-immigration activists with America’s Voice brought a petition to NBC’s studios on Wednesday, presenting the network with more than 500,000 signatures petitioning it to disinvite Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this week, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus also sent a letter to the show, asking producers to disinvite the billionaire and saying his “demonizing Latinos and immigrants has created fear within these communities around the country”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several organizations, including pro-immigration Make the Road New York and the League of United Latin American Citizens, planned to protest again on Saturday night. A Pac called DeportRacism.com has offered $5,000 in cash to anyone on set or in the audience who disrupted the program by denouncing Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If he were to call black Americans rapists, murderers and drug dealers, that woud not fly,” Montgomery said from his home in Mexico. “So why is it OK that he would say that about Latinos? Saturday Night Live is really disgusting for having him on.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saturday Night Live had increased security measures, according to Montgomery, who said he remained hopeful that someone would manage to heckle the billionaire at least in earshot of microphones. The Hollywood Reporter noted that audience members have to pass through higher levels of security when presidential candidates appear on the show, but that six protesters did manage to disturb a broadcast in 1992. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NBC and SNL have declined to comment on the contradiction between the decision to cancel contracts with Trump and the decision to feature him on a marquee program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protest organizer Santiago Cejudo said in a statement that the group hopes to use Trump’s appearance to denounce his positions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s 2016, and Trump needs to hear that you can’t win the White House without the brown vote,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump dismissed the protesters earlier in the week, saying their demonstrations would only create more publicity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be,” he said at a press conference. “It’s going to be one of their highest-rated shows ever and they’re very excited about it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other groups have accused NBC of giving Trump the equivalent of an extended campaign ad and legitimizing his remarks. One protester, Karina Garcia, told the network’s news arm racism was “like a tumor that if you ignore it, it actually spreads”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s unconscionable that they would do this, that they would give him this stage,” she told NBC News, which has reported the protests despite the network’s official silence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 65 prominent Latinos condemned Trump in a joint statement on Friday, saying his “hate speech appeals to xenophobia, sexism and political intolerance; it recalls historical campaigns against other ethnic groups that led to millions of deaths”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday the actor John Leguizamo told Yahoo News he would not watch SNL anymore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You’re celebrating someone who has said some horrible things,” he said. “If he had said those things about any other ethnic group, he would not be on SNL.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s current rival at the top of the Republican polls, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, said in October he would never appear on Saturday Night Live. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious thing,” he told Bloomberg Politics. “I don’t even want to begin to put it in the lightness of comedy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SNL’s decision to book Trump as host has largely been perceived as a ploy to win high ratings, which have eluded the comedy show in recent years. The show broke its rating records in 2008 when vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin appeared alongside comedian and writer Tina Fey, who played her in a skit.",
