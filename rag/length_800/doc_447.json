NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It comes from the fossilised bones of a foot that were discovered in Ethiopia and dated to be 3.4 million years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers say they do not have enough remains to identify the species of hominin, or human ancestor, from which the right foot came. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Butthey tell Nature journalthat just the shape of the bones shows the creature could walk upright at times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fossil haul consists of eight elements from the forefoot - bones such as metatarsals and phalanges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The specimens were pulled from clay sediments at Burtele in the central Afar region, about 520km north-east of the capital Addis Ababa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is a significant discovery because it demonstrates there was more than one pre-human species living in East Africa between three and four million years ago, each with its own method of moving around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image caption The eight elements are all from the forefoot NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The other creature was the famous \"Lucy\" animal (Australopithecus afarensis), whose remains were first identified in the Afar in the 1970s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lucy's body was built for walking. Her big toe was aligned with the other four digits of the foot, and she had a human-like arch that allowed for very efficient locomotion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The owner of the partial foot from Burtele was notafarensis; that can be said definitively. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fossils indicate it had no arch and the big toe was opposed to the other digits, enabling the animal to grasp branches in a tree. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the fact this creature could and would walk on the ground is evidenced by the nature of the bone joints. These were arranged such that the foot could push off, or toe-off - something only humans do as they walk, and something flat-footed apes cannot achieve. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you look at the lateral metatarsal head along with the proximal toe bone, the phalanx - that particular joint is really unique in hominids,\" explained team member Dr Bruce Latimer of Case Western Reserve University, US. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can see it's a very different kind of a joint, because when you toe-off and push forward in that last phase of walking, your toes are highly flexed. In order to achieve that, you have to change the base of the phalanx and the metatarsal head - you have to change both sides of the joint. And it's a highly characteristic type of change that we can pick out immediately,\" he told the BBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scientists can only speculate as to identity of the Burtele species. Without skull and teeth elements, a formal classification is impossible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team says the animal's morphology is reminiscent in some respects to a 4.4-million-year-old creature known asArdipithecus ramidus. Although, again, it is notramidus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It may be a relic species that was lingering around until 3.4 or 3.3 million years ago, and which had its origins way back inArdipithecus ramidustimes,\" suggested team leader Dr Yohannes Haile-Selassie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image caption The initial find was made in 2009. The analysis has continued since then NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But obviously we cannot put it into theArdipithecusgenus or call it aramidusspecies because we do not have any craniodental elements associated with this foot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've kept digging at the Burtele site; we have a few isolated teeth, but that's all,\" the Cleveland Museum of Natural History curator told BBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is, though, a remarkable thought that there were these two very distinct species effectively rubbing shoulders with each other 3.4 million years ago in what is now Ethiopia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The landmark Lucy specimen unearthed in 1974 was found at Hadar, about 50km from Burtele. Other remains ofafarensishave been discovered closer still. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Isabelle De Groote is a palaeoanthropologist at London's Natural History Museum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think this is really exciting,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have so few foot remains, they so rarely preserve, that we tend to take great leaps through evolution where there are no specimens at all representing long periods of time,\" she commented. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This new foot helps elucidate the process of how the bi-pedal foot evolved. We can see something of the sequence in how changes to bones occurred.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me onTwitter NEWLINE_CHAR the periods can The was the the Dr is whose is NEWLINE_CHAR ancestor, De is elements at NEWLINE_CHAR ramidustimes,\" Hadar, one NEWLINE_CHAR human-like isolated long your our NEWLINE_CHAR came. to said that occurred.\" The metatarsal",
