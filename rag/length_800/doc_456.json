    "0": "The best climate policy – environmentally and economically – limits emissions and puts a price on them. Cap and trade is one way to do both. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s a system designed to reduce pollution in our atmosphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cap on greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming is a firm limit on pollution. The cap gets stricter over time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trade part is a market for companies to buy and sell allowances that let them emit only a certain amount, as supply and demand set the price. Trading gives companies a strong incentive to save money by cutting emissions in the most cost-effective ways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caps limit harmful emissions NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government sets the cap across a given industry, or ideally the whole economy. It also decides the penalties for violations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carbon dioxide and related pollutants that drive global warming are main targets of such caps. Other pollutants that contribute to smog can also be capped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In carbon dioxide's case, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas mixes into the upper atmosphere and has a global effect. Reducing emissions locally lowers levels around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies are allowed to emit set amounts NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The total amount of the cap is split into allowances, each permitting a company to emit one ton of emissions. (You'd have to drive 2,400 miles, roughly the distance between New York and Las Vegas, to emit that much carbon dioxide.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government distributes the allowances to the companies, either for free or through an auction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cap typically declines over time, providing a growing incentive for industry and businesses to reduce their emissions more efficiently, while keeping production costs down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trading can lead to cuts in pollution sooner NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies that cut their pollution faster can sell allowances to companies that pollute more, or \"bank\" them for future use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This market – the \"trade\" part of cap and trade – gives companies flexibility. It increases the pool of available capital to make reductions, encourages companies to cut pollution faster and rewards innovation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cap and trade lets the market find the cheapest way to cut emissions. Nathaniel Keohane, Vice President, Global Climate NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because there are only so many allowances available, total pollution drops as the cap falls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As companies use established techniques to lower emissions, such as adopting energy-efficient technology, entrepreneurs see opportunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ever wonder why you don't hear about acid rain anymore? Thank cap and trade, which slashed levels of sulfur dioxide to solve the problem – at a fraction of the projected cost. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cap and trade is lowering emissions globally NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A market-based approach like cap and trade allows countries to make more ambitious climate goals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Environmental enforcement officials, trained by EDF, conduct an on-site inspection at a factory in China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, launched the initial phase of a national carbon market in 2017 with help from EDF. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new emissions trading system is expected to be the world’s largest, dwarfing all existing programs, and is a central component of China’s strategy to tackle climate pollution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The national program builds on pilot emissions trading systems, which have included elements of cap and trade and are already underway in seven cities and provinces in China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They cover more than 2,600 companies in regions with a population of more than 258 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the European Union's Emissions Trading System, capped emissions from stationary structures were 26 percent lower in 2016 than when the program started in 2005. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the United States, California’s climate policies have led to a steady decline of the state's carbon dioxide pollution. The centerpiece is the cap-and-trade program, which EDF has helped design and implement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California's emissions from sources subject to the cap declined 8.8 percent between the program’s launch in 2013 and 2016. Meanwhile, the state’s economy is thriving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cap and trade makes even deeper cuts possible when countries cooperate, such as the United States and Canada. California and Quebec connected their systems in 2014, building a strong market that shows great potential.
