(Hoang Dinh Nam, AFP/Getty Images / ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a long-awaited study that helped prompt a contentious debate over the wisdom of conducting research that has the potential to help as well as harm, scientists reported Wednesday that they had engineered a mutant strain of bird flu that can spread easily between ferrets — a laboratory animal that responds to flu viruses much as people do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That means that bird flu has \"the potential to acquire the ability to transmit in mammals,\" said University of Wisconsin virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka, who led the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only a few mutations were necessary for the transformation, he added, which suggests that a more contagious strain of bird flu could emerge on its own without targeted prodding by scientists in the lab. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kawaoka's discovery, published online after a months-long delay by the journal Nature, dampens hopes that the deadly H5N1 virus simply wasn't capable of becoming a highly contagious bug in mammals, including humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He and his team developed a hybrid bird flu virus that combined an H5 hemagglutinin gene — which helps viruses bind to host cells — with genes from 2009's pandemic H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using a sort of selective breeding to favor flu strains whose H5 protein could bind with human rather than bird host cells, the researchers developed a version of the virus with four mutations in its H5 that sickened ferrets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pathogen traveled in respiratory droplets through the air to infect ferrets in adjacent cages. It did not kill any of the animals used in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., said that the changes in the virus Kawaoka's team identified had all been seen before, but that scientists had not recognized that together they could make a flu virus spread more easily among mammals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a great place to start looking for exactly what's going on,\" he said, noting that researchers still don't understand how changes in host organisms affect transmissibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The publication of Kawaoka's paper comes after months of debate over his research and experiments conducted in the lab of Dutch virologist Ron Fouchier, who has also developed strains of bird flu that can pass between ferrets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The worry, voiced by biosecurity experts, was that nefarious-minded people could use details provided in the papers to turn bird flu into a biological weapon of sorts and inflict widespread harm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the last 15 years or so, the H5N1 virus has killed millions of chickens and ducks. Very few people — 602, according to the latest World Health Organization estimate — have been infected since the latest outbreak in 2003, but 355 of them died. That has fueled concerns that a contagious strain of the virus could spawn a pandemic, potentially causing millions of deaths around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fear that a pandemic strain could emerge in nature prompted scientists to study its potential to mutate, so that they could monitor new variants as they arise and get a head start on developing a vaccine and treatment. The National Institutes of Health helped fund Kawaoka's and Fouchier's studies in high-security labs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the scientists were ready to publish their results, critics said the research could be used as a recipe for bioterrorism — assuming a dangerous strain of the virus wasn't stolen directly from a laboratory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A U.S. government advisory panel recommended in November that Nature as well as Science, the journal that planned to publish Fouchier's research, remove sensitive details from the papers. It was an unprecedented step. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The journals agreed to delay publication and virologists put their H5N1 research on hold while the scientific and security communities debated their next steps. Ultimately, the advisory panel decided the papers were safe to publish, but the release of Kawaoka's research — and the expected publication shortly of Fouchier's — won't mark the end of the conversation, scientists said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are still a lot of unknowns about how this will be dealt with going forward,\" Webby said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the meantime, Kawaoka said he hoped his research would help public health workers trying to fight the spread of H5N1 by suggesting useful mutations to incorporate in vaccines or to track as the virus spreads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the mutations his team identified is already circulating in viruses in the Middle East and Asia, he said.
