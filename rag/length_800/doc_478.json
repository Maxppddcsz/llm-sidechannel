    "0": "Exclusive: Carol Bartz Out at Yahoo; CFO Tim Morse Named Interim CEO NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to sources at the company, Yahoo’s Carol Bartz is no longer CEO of Yahoo. CFO Tim Morse has been named interim CEO. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The situation around what is clearly an ouster is uncertain, but Bartz has had a very rocky tenure in her 32 months at the company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [UPDATE: Yahoo confirmed the departure of Bartz in a press release outlining a reorganization.] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bartz also sent a stunning email to staff, saying she had been ousted: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To all, I am very sad to tell you that I’ve just been fired over the phone by Yahoo’s Chairman of the Board. It has been my pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you only the best going forward. Carol NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several sources said the board, specifically Chairman Roy Bostock and Co-founder, as well as director Jerry Yang, acted today, informing Bartz by phone of the need to make a change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What the next steps will be are unclear, but Yahoo needs desperately to explore a range of strategic changes to bring it back to its former glory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Wall Street liked the move, with Yahoo stock up more than six percent already in after-hours trading. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sources said Morse held a call with Yahoo’s senior staff this afternoon, telling them Bartz was out and that a search for a permanent CEO will be commencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why Yahoo’s board did not name a new leader immediately is curious and might indicate a larger deal around Yahoo is in the offing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As I wrote earlier today, when the Internet giant announced on January 13, 2009, that it had hired longtime Silicon Valley tech veteran — who was well-regarded for her tenure at running Autodesk — to replace outgoing CEO and co-founder Yang and turn around the company, there was much hope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, she presented a take-no-prisoners image and was touted as someone with a reputation as a professional manager who could clean up the place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not so, as it has turned out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Bartz has streamlined certain areas and made some strong management hires, her performance has been decidedly bumpy and mostly downhill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The share price has settled in at about $12.50 (just about where it was when Bartz took over), Yahoo’s recent financial results have been weak, its key advertising business is struggling, its attrition rate among engineers and others is startlingly high and its product innovation cycle seems stopped up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Add to that: Weak relationships with key Asian partners, a pricey but failed marketing effort and a proclivity for embarrassing verbal gaffes by Bartz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, given that Yahoo’s Internet traffic, top media sites and brand remain huge, the going-sideways situation has again caused some investors — including powerful private equity firms and other monied investors — to pull out their spreadsheets about a variety of scenarios related to Yahoo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The players who have sniffed around of late are powerful, sources said, including Silver Lake Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, former News Corp. exec Peter Chernin and Providence Equity Partners, among others. Also in the Wall Street rumor mill recently are large companies: AT&T, News Corp. and Verizon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the schemes are different — ranging from taking it private to making a large investment to splitting it into parts — although they all seem to require cooperation with Yahoo to get done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while there is no serious effort afoot as yet, there have been increasing signs of late that Yahoo’s board is ready to listen to any serious offers, said multiple sources, especially as the company has continued to drift under the leadership of Bartz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While board chairman Bostock has publicly backed Bartz — after all, he was her biggest champion at the time of her hiring — multiple sources said he had started to become more involved at looking at the management issues at the company and its challenges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yang — still a key figure at Yahoo — has also become more active, said sources, and tensions between him and Bartz have increased over the last few months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The increasing pressure on the directors of the company from its major shareholders to act has gained in recent months, said sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thus, Bartz is gone and the next chapter in Yahoo’s corporate drama begins.
