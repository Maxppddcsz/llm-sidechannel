    "0": "Tim Tebow — one of the most extraordinary athletes ever to pass through Denver — was run out of town Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was all about pass and run — not about popularity, polarization, positive force and personality, faith, hope and charity, and mile-high regard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everybody in the world knows Timmy can run. He produced that remarkable run to the postseason for the Broncos last season. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But not everybody, especially the Broncos' brass, is certain he can pass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paradoxically, Tebow's final pass in Denver resulted in an 80-yard touchdown that won an overtime playoff game for the Broncos against the Steelers. After a contract snafu that held up the deal for hours Wednesday, Tebow was banished to the Jets, where he will start all over, but not start. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Peyton Manning decided to bring his incredible talent to the Broncos, inevitably, it was one more Tebow Time — time to leave. Parting is such sweet sorrow, as Shakespeare wrote, and best for Tim and the Broncos, best for the evenly divided Tebow believers and the Tebow disbelievers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Half the people are wringing their hands over Tebow's departure; the other half are ringing the church bells. But all the people should feel fortunate that young Tim was here for a while. He is an amazing fellow, and he did lead the Broncos back to the playoffs, and he did make it absorbing Shakespeare-like theatre. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If, after Tebow had taken over at quarterback in the second half of the Chargers game, the Broncos had wallowed in mediocrity the rest of the season and finished with a 4-12 record (again), Manning wouldn't have cared to come to this organization. If Tebow hadn't taken over, the Broncos might have ended up with a 2-14 record and been in position to draft Andrew Luck or Robert Griffin III. Funny how things work out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tim is special. Someday Tebow will prove himself as an exceptional NFL quarterback — runner and passer — but that just won't happen with the Broncos. Someday, as I've written, Tebow, with his platform, will be much more than a football player. He could be a preacher, politician, philanthropist or philosopher. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has remained quiet publicly the past two weeks, but someone very close to him told me that Tebow was \"all right, and everything will work out the way it's supposed to.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is unique. Ask the youngsters with debilitating illnesses who have been invited to games by Tebow. Ask the adults who have met him. Ask teammates who have played with him. Ask the kids who were throwing around a football at a playground recently when Tebow suddenly got out of a car and held an impromptu clinic. Ask his close friend Angel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is ubiquitous, given the Tebowing, the multitudes who have followed him and been thrilled by him, the Jack Armstrong All-American boy qualities and his appearances at Hollywood awards shows, Walmarts for signings of his best-selling autobiography and Disney World with Make-A-Wish teenagers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past couple of days, the most frequent questions among Broncos fans were: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why are the Broncos getting rid of Tebow? Because they signed Peyton Manning, and he's the only (available) quarterback that could have displaced Tebow, and Elway et al. feel they can win the Super Bowl soon with Manning, probably not with Tebow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why did they not keep Tebow as the backup now and the starter in the future? Because it wouldn't have worked. Tebow wouldn't get the necessary work in practices or games to help his development as a passer. Tebow's contract runs out before Manning's, so he would have left, anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why didn't the Broncos move him to another position or use him as a wildcat? Because Tebow has been told his whole life he couldn't be a quarterback, and he is determined to be a long-term starting quarterback in pro football. He wouldn't move. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why did John Elway say Tebow would be the starter in training camp if he didn't mean it? Because Elway didn't realize then there would be a chance at Manning. The sincere intention by the Broncos was to play Tebow next season. But the only thing constant in sports is change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why did the Broncos think Tebow couldn't become a great passer? Because of his flawed throwing mechanics and footwork. Now the Jets, Tebow's new team, must address those — and many other — issues, including Tebowing and Tebowmania. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And never again will a young man or quarterback quite like Tim Tebow run or pass this way again.
