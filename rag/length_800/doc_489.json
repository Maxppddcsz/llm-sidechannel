KENS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gilbert Flores, who was shot to death by police officers responding to a domestic disturbance call. (Photo: Bexar County Sheriff's Office) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A second video has emerged showing two Texas police officers shoot and kill a man who appears to have had his hands up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new video shows, a \"very clear view\" of the confrontation, Bexar County District Attorney Nico LaHood said Tuesday. LaHood said it was unclear what the suspect's intent was in raising his hands and cautioned against a rush to judgment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't know what his intent was,\" he said. \"All I can tell you is the video is disturbing. But my encouragement to everyone is to press the pause button.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CLOSE A new emergency radio recording from an incident near San Antonio in which a man was fatally shot by deputies has been released. The call shows that the man was threatening suicide. VPC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooting was first seen by the public in cell phone footage obtained by a local TV station, KSAT, and available on its website, which shows two San Antonio-area sheriff's deputies shooting 41-year-old Gilbert Flores Friday after they responded to a domestic disturbance call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to another station, KENS-TV, police said the deputies found a woman who was bleeding from her head and holding a toddler, who also may have been hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At first, Flores is seen running shirtless in front of a home as the officers approach him. He then seems to put his hands up moments before they shoot him to the ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He put his hands in the air and they just shot him twice,\" Michael Thomas, the man who KSAT says filmed the video, told the station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the incident, the officers were identified by police officials as Greg Vasquez and Robert Sanchez. Both have more than 10 years on the force, and have been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thomas said he recorded the incident because of increased publicity about police-involved killings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thought with everything going on in the world, with police shootings and everything, I thought I would record what was happening,\" he told CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bexar County Sheriff's Office said Flores was armed with a knife and resisting arrest when deputies showed up. Neither deputy was wearing a body camera. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are aware that there is recorded video which appears to show the final moments of this deputy-involved shooting,\" Bexar County Sheriff Susan Pamerleau said Friday. \"It's among many pieces of evidence that we are collecting to determine what happened.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incident began when deputies received a call to a block in the northwest section of the city regarding a woman who allegedly had been assaulted, according to Bexar County Sheriff's Office public information officer James Keith. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Keith, Flores at one point grabbed a deputy's taser and threw it as deputies attempted to use non-lethal force during the approximately 20-minute confrontation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the video is shot from a distance, it's not clear whether Flores is holding a knife, and though it's clear Flores has one hand up, the other is obscured by a utility pole. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As the guy and police were going back and forth, the man acted like he was going to run back inside his house and then ran around the cars by the cop car and the cops started pursuing closer to him,\" Thomas told CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities said Flores resisted arrest, and that nonlethal force — stun guns and shields — were used to try to subdue him, but those didn't work, Pamerleau said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Certainly what's in the video is a cause for concern,\" Pamerleau said. \"But it's important to let the investigation go through its course so we can ensure a thorough and complete review of all that occurred.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bexar County District Attorney's Office has joined the investigation, according to KSAT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nicholas \"Nico\" LaHood, the Bexar County district attorney, told KSAT there's a second video of the incident that has a closer and clearer view of what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR James Keith, media relations officer for the Bexar County Sheriff's Office, confirmed to CNN that his office has a second video of the shooting by someone else, but he would not go into detail about what it shows.
