NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malik posted a statement of support for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook \"just before the attack,\" one official familiar with the issue said. Facebook said it pulled the post down after the shooting, CNBC confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelations Friday came before the FBI announced they are investigating Wednesday's mass shooting as an act of terrorism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FBI Director James Comey said they uncovered \"indications of radicalization\" and possible \"inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have no indication that these killers are part of an organized larger group or form part of a cell,\" he said. \"There's no indication that they are part of a network.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Full Coverage: San Bernardino Shooting Massacre NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neither Malik nor her husband Syed Rizwan Farook were on the FBI's radar prior to the attack. \"There is nothing in our holdings about these two killers,\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier Friday, Farook's brother-in-law insisted the slain suspect was an observant Muslim but not a \"radical\" and never gave any indication of what may have motivated him and his wife to launch a terror attack with four guns and explosives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Farook, 28, and Malik, 27, were killed in a shootout with police a few miles away — and more than four hours — after the bloodbath in San Bernardino. They had left their 6-month-old daughter with Farook's mom before they went off to commit mass murder, police said.

You're looking at a multi-stage process that actually starts in the United States with a petition from a U.S. citizen.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked whether in the wake of the shooting the visa process should be toughened, Trudeau said \"we always need to adapt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We can always do better and that is something the State Department stands behind,\" she said. \"We did it after 9/11.
