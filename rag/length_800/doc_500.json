NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A crowd watches firefighters pull a man's body up to a 17th-floor balcony Monday on a high-rise at 12th and K streets. Markers, spray paint and an etching tool indicated the man was intending to leave graffiti behind. He had lowered himself using a rope left behind by window washers. Police say the rope tightened around his chest, cutting off his breathing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the span of 15 days, Sacramento authorities have reported the deaths of two men from apparent graffiti attempts at elevated heights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest was discovered Monday morning after employees at a high-rise at 1201 K St. reported seeing a body hanging from rope outside the 16th floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sacramento police spokeswoman Michele Gigante said the victim apparently died accidentally while trying to vandalize the building's exterior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On March 16, a convicted tagger, Andre Petkov, 22, of North Highlands, was discovered by a street sweeper after apparently falling from the Interstate 80 bridge east of Winters Street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Petkov had been arrested and convicted in 2009 for vandalism in the Sacramento and Roseville areas and was a member of the Sacramento Graffiti Killers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, Gigante said the deaths of the two apparent taggers \"look like they are completely independent issues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The man who died at the high-rise was not identified by authorities Monday pending notification of his relatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities said gravity played a role in both deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Petkov fell to his death from the overpass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Battalion Chief Craig Wiedenhoeft, of the Sacramento Fire Department, said the man they removed Monday accidentally asphyxiated himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wiedenhoeft said the rope that looped around his chest and legs had constricted him. \"He got pulled into a fetal position when the rope cinched up on him,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't known Monday how the man reached the top of the high-rise, known locally as the \"Ban Roll-on building.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Wiedenhoeft, the man used an antiquated mountaineering technique to begin his descent. He used a rope left by window washers to descend to a landing on the 17th floor. Then, after retying the rope, he descended to the 16th floor, Wiedenhoeft said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local climbing experts said the \"classic rappel\" technique is seldom practiced. It uses friction from the rope against the body at various points to slow the descent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's not used much anymore. There is equipment that is a lot more efficient, so nobody really does it,\" said Adam Elfstrand, general manager Granite Arch Climbing Center in Rancho Cordova. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Sacramento Pipeworks climbing gym in downtown Sacramento, climber Jason Bove described the technique as \"unorthodox\" and \"not recommended.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victim was noticed at 7:50 a.m., and firefighters recovered the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gigante said markers, glass etching tools that could be used to deface glass, and spray paint were found at the scene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, Gigante said police have no evidence to suggest the deaths of the two men are related. She described them as a coincidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It just so happens that we had these two deaths within the same month,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sacramento Police Department used to have a graffiti unit that focused on identifying gang markings. It was disbanded because of the budget crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2009, the Roseville Police Department went undercover to bust the group calling itself the Sacramento Graffiti Killers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That was their life  tagging,\" said Officer Ryan Bal. \"Whatever else they did, was just to pass the time until they could get tagging.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said at that time taggers would post pictures of their work on Myspace. He and another officer interacted with them on Myspace until they finally met face-to-face. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said they idolized well-known graffiti artists, especially those tagging prominent locations. \"It's all about visibility,\" he said. \"It's all about getting as many people to see it as possible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They all think of themselves as artists. They do have artistic ability, but what they are doing is not art,\" Bal said. \"Artists don't vandalize other people's property.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the effort to gain notoriety has been deadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've had two deaths now in the area,\" Bal said. \"They are putting themselves at risk to get their name out there.\" Call The Bee's Ed Fletcher, (916) 321-1269.
