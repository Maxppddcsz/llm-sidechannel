NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A herd of deer jumped the 80th Street SW bridge over Highway 30 in Cedar Rapids on Sunday, Dec. 10, 2017. (Photo: Courtesy of Catherine Veerhusen) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Catherine Veerhusen and her husband were driving northbound along the 80th Street SW bridge over U.S. Highway 30 in Cedar Rapids on Sunday when they spotted a herd of deer in front of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They had hoped the herd would somehow stay away from oncoming traffic while also not jumping over the bridge's west side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the Atkins couple witnessed the lone buck sprint across to the opposite side of the bridge and vault over the bridge's sidewall to an estimated \"20- to 30-foot\" drop. The three does immediately followed — all leaping to their deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Veerhusen was horrified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I've never seen anything like this,\" she told the Des Moines Register on Tuesday. \"No words, no words.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow The Des Moines Register on Facebook | Download the Des Moines Register app NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Ron Lane, a conservation officer with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources in Linn County, left the scene Tuesday afternoon, the three does remained but the buck was nowhere to be found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He believes the herd was panicked and not familiar with the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The bridge there is brand new,\" Lane said. \"I'm guessing the deer aren't used to that, with all of the construction going on.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 80th Street SW bridge, part of a larger construction project to connect Highway 100 from Edgewood Road west and south to Highway 30, opened to commuters in October, according to the Cedar Rapids Gazette. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, Iowa is in the midst of its second shotgun deer season, which Lane thinks could be another contributor the herd's disorientation, with hunters pushing them back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It sounds like with they were just trying to run across and didn't know where to go,\" Lane said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Lane, Veerhusen also referred to the deer as \"panicked.\" Riding in the passenger's seat of her vehicle, she explained what she saw at around 3:15 p.m. Sunday afternoon: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We see these deer cross the ramp in front of us and we're like, 'OK, don't go over the bridge,'\" Veerhusen explained. \"They went straight for the bridge. And we slowly NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR came up to them, keeping our distance, and we saw that this car was flying up (the road). We got in front of that car to slow them down. I don't think they saw these deer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Veerhusens slowed down Denny Benyshek, 50, of Fairfax. He told the Register he first saw the deer from about 200 yards out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were driving slow by them,\" Benyshek said as he and the Veerhusens got closer. \"The buck was leading the whole time — then he just bolts straight east. The three doe followed him over.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that the event lasted just 15 seconds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was pretty quick. I didn't even get to my phone in time. I was more busy watching them,\" Benyshek said, adding that he's a deer hunter. \"I seen this rack and thought, 'That's a nice buck.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Benyshek and Veerhusen exchanged contact information, photos and video footage. Shortly after, Veerhusen posted her photos and video on her personal Facebook page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 2-second clip has accumulated millions of views, and the post has been shared more than 250,000 times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had to shut her account's notifications off due to the number of interactions the post generated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It has just taken off like crazy,\" Veerhusen said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Benyshek, who's tagged in the post, agrees. He even went back out to the site around 5:45 p.m. Sunday and noticed the buck was missing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I told my wife today this is getting crazy. ... I had to put my phone down,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Looking back, though, Veerhusen wishes she'd called the local sheriff's department. She and her husband stayed for \"probably a good 10 to 15 minutes\" afterward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I stood there — I was just in shock,\" Veerhusen said. \" ... I've never seen them spooked like that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interested in trending Iowa news? Follow @AaYoung15 on Twitter.
