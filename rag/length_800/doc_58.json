NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Python hatchlings were discovered for the first time on Key Largo, an ominous development for the island's wildlife, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Thursday. And last week, a 10-foot python was found on a levee at the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in western Palm Beach County, indicating that the huge constrictor may have staked out territory in the northernmost section of the Everglades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The big snakes, which can swim, have been found for years on Key Largo. But the discovery of three hatchlings in August represent the first evidence that they have established a breeding population there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We worry about pythons becoming established in the Keys because there are several at-risk populations of small mammals, like the Key Largo woodrat and the Key Largo cotton mouse, that would be easy prey for Burmese pythons,\" said Bryan Falk, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The python at the Loxahatchee refuge was discovered by a law enforcement officer driving on a levee at night, just west of West Delray Regional Park. Upon seeing the python, he hit the brakes but ran over it. The snake was still alive, so he killed it with a machete, said Steve Henry, deputy project leader at the refuge.

Although three pythons had been found previously on the refuge, they all turned out to be released pets. If analysis of its DNA and stomach contents reveal it to be a wild python, it would be the first such snake found on the refuge, Henry said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The main concern would be the refuge's small mammals, such as raccoons, opossums and woodrats, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you look at what happened with the python at Everglades National Park, it started with the small mammals,\" he said. \"Their populations just imploded.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two deer, seven alligators, eight opossums, and miscellaneous rats, birds, rabbits, raccoons and squirrels. That’s the haul removed from the intestinal tracts of the pythons caught earlier this year in the state’s Python Challenge public snake hunting competition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Native to southern Asia, Burmese pythons established a breeding population in Everglades National Park in the 1990s, as a by-product of the exotic pet business. There are thought to be some combination of released pets and escapees from a breeding facility damaged in Hurricane Andrew. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one knows the extent of their South Florida range, said Kristen Sommers, exotic species coordinator for the state wildlife commission. Beyond Everglades National Park, they are likely to be established in other parts of the Everglades, as well as state parks and hunting lands to the west and north of the Everglades, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's also unknown how far they could spread, although the relatively cold winters of Central Florida could serve as a rough limit, she said. Even the mild winters of South Florida have in the past held down the populations of non-native species such as iguanas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she said the warm weather of the past few years, with the lack of severe winter cold snaps, has likely allowed pythons and other",
