NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The call, made by a child welfare employee with the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, came into the Clark County emergency dispatch center shortly after 10:30 a.m. on March 26 — the same day the Harts’ vehicle was found at the bottom of a 100-foot cliff off the Pacific Coast Highway in Northern California, according to KOIN6. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee told 911 dispatchers she had tried to contact the family multiple times but had been unsuccessful, so she was calling 911 to request a welfare check, the outlet reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Who are we checking on?” the Clark County emergency dispatcher asks the worker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The mothers are Sarah and Jennifer Hart, and according to my intake, they have six children in the home,” the worker says on the call, KTPV reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve been to the home Monday and Friday and knocked on the door just this morning, and I can get no response,” the worker says. “Different cars have been moving in and out, I noticed, so I feel like someone is there.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked why she was checking on the children, the worker says the department received “concerns that the children aren’t being fed,” CBS News reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On March 26, five of the eight members of the Hart family — parents Jennifer and Sarah and three of their children — were discovered dead at the bottom of the cliff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities have also said that Devonte, 15, Hannah, 16, and Sierra Hart, 12, remain unaccounted for and are feared dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, officials from the California Highway Patrol announced that a body had been found “in the surf” around Highway 1, an area which is “in the immediate vicinity of the recent Hart Family crash.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The body found on Saturday “appears to be that of an African American Female but the age and a positive identity could not be determined,” states a press release from the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An autopsy on the body is pending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mendocino Sheriff/Facebook NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three days before the crash was reported, Washington State Department of Social and Health Services received a call reporting that the six Hart children appeared to be “potential victims of alleged abuse or neglect,” Norah West, the department’s spokeswoman, previously told PEOPLE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2011, Sarah pleaded guilty to an abuse charge, admitting to taking her daughter into the bathroom, bending her over the edge of the bathtub and hitting her on the backside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sarah was originally charged with domestic assault and malicious punishment, according to court records. She agreed to plead guilty to the domestic assault charge and the malicious punishment charge was dropped.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheriff: Crash Was a Crime and Not an Accident NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mendocino County Sheriff Tom Allman said on April 4 that he believes the crash was a crime and not an accident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m to the point where I no longer am calling this an accident; I’m calling it a crime,” Allman said during an appearance on HLN’s Crime & Justice with Ashleigh Banfield. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Previously, authorities cited information pulled from the vehicle’s software as evidence that the vehicle may have purposefully been driven off the cliff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Capt. Greg Baarts with the California Highway Patrol’s Northern Division said the Harts’ SUV was stopped at a flat, dirt pull-off area before it sped off the steep rocky face and plunged down toward the water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baarts also cited the lack of skid marks near the cliff’s edge — indicating that the vehicle did not attempt to brake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, police have not discussed a possible motive or whether a link exists between the crash and child abuse allegations in the family’s past — including Sarah’s guilty plea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dekalbs, a neighbor couple, have told local media that they reported the suspected abuse of the children, and said that when state workers knocked on the Harts’ door, the family was allegedly home but did not answer.
