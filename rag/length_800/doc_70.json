Reynolds Boyce told The Telegram earlier this week her test results identified her as a Beothuk, a Newfoundland First Nation thought to be extinct since 1829. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related story: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Woman says DNA test proves she is Beothuk NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reynolds Boyce, 55, has established a Facebook site called Beothuk Tribe of NFLD and North America Reservation Nation, and said her mother and brother also tested positive for Beothuk DNA. She said her family voted her chief of the Beothuk First Nation, and she is in the midst of trying to get federal recognition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reynolds Boyce told The Telegram she would soon take applications from people looking to join the nation, and is accepting donations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Since I am the chief of the Beothuk, why don’t you all take the donated money and assist me in relocation of me and my tribal members, what would be a kind gesture, don’t you think?” Reynolds Boyce posted on Facebook. “Our Beothuk ancestors left the island of NFLD, but we just need assistance in coming back to live at our village and tribal lands.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reynolds Boyce also posted that, “Some are jealous, hatred because that means land entitled to our tribe.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Thursday’s Telegram, Accu-Metrics laboratory manager Kyle Tsui said the company used genetic information from a 2007 published study that examined mitochondrial DNA taken from the remains of two Beothuk people, Desmaduit and Nonosabasut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study declared genetic matches between the Beothuk couple and present-day Nova Scotia Mi’kmaq and certain Cherokee, Chippawa and Kiowa people of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That study was refuted in 2011, when a second study argued the DNA data from the Beothuk remains did not support a close genetic relationship between Beothuk and Mi’kmaq people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Memorial University biology professor Steve Carr, who specializes in genetics and evolution (and co-wrote the 2011 paper), didn’t mince his words when he told The Telegram earlier in the week that Accu-Metrics’ DNA test was invalid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The DNA taken from the remains is too small and incomplete for a match to be determined, he said, and not necessarily exclusive to the Beothuk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Were the company to produce a report now to show a ‘perfect match’ between the woman and one of the 2007 (genetic) sequences, it would reinforce the assumption of fakery,” Carr said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the notion that there are people of part-Beothuk heritage still living is generally not contested, most experts appear to agree with Carr that a determination of Beothuk DNA based on the 2007 genetic information is impossible at this point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Accu-Metrics is seemingly the only business offering DNA testing for ancestry claiming the ability to prove Beothuk heritage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tsui stood by Reynolds Boyce’s test results Thursday morning, saying her DNA proved to be a match with the genetic information from 2007, but when asked his opinion on her establishment of a First Nation and request for donations based on her test results, he said, “The test that we do is not a legal test, it’s just for informational purposes, just like many of these genetic tests that are on the market. You can’t use it as any evidence whatsoever. It’s just for informational purposes. You can’t take it to court and so forth.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The website for Accu-Metrics, which also offers paternity testing, drug testing, dog breed testing and other services, says, “All tests can be done for legal purposes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tsui reportedly told another media outlet late Thursday Accu-Metrics would remove any reference to the Beothuk from its genetic database. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He didn’t return calls from The Telegram on Friday, but another Accu-Metrics employee confirmed the Beothuk testing is still being offered. Beothuk is still listed on the company’s website as one of the First Nations/Native American tribes it’s able to match on DNA testing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reynolds Boyce didn’t return a request for comment from The Telegram on Friday, either, although a number of posts on her Beothuk First Nation Facebook page were deleted, including one that declared, “Beothuk First Nation constitution laws do not permit disrespect to the chief of the tribe amongst its members. The chief is the door to your membership and if you can’t respect the chief at the door, then the chief does not let you in.” of a to our island the the is NEWLINE_CHAR said. family market.
