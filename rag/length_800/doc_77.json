NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR / Updated By Maggie Fox NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breast implants can cause a rare form of cancer that may have killed at least nine people, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Breast augmentation is the second most popular cosmetic procedure among women, after liposuction. More than 300,000 procedures were performed in 2015. So the cancer would be very rare even with 300 cases over 10 years or longer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the FDA says it is easily treated if caught early enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Most cases of breast implant-associated ALCL are treated by removal of the implant and the capsule surrounding the implant and some cases have been treated by chemotherapy and radiation,\" it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Suspicions have been growing that implants might cause ALCL, which is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.The FDA first started looking into the possibility in 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “At that time, the FDA knew of so few cases of this disease that it was not possible to determine what factors increased the risk,” the agency said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But now there’s more information, including hundreds of complaints and a World Health Organization report pointing to breast implants as a possible cause. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As of February 1, 2017, the FDA has received a total of 359 medical device reports of breast-implant-associated ALCL, including nine deaths,” it said.

They come in different sizes and shapes and have either smooth or textured surfaces (shells),” it says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FDA added, “There are 231 reports that included information on the implant surface. Of these, 203 were reported to be textured implants and 28 reported to be smooth implants.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cancer can take about 10 years to develop on average after the implant first goes in and usually stays in the area right around the implant, WHO researchers reported last year in the journal Blood. But it can break out and spread. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s usually diagnosed after a patient reports pain and swelling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FDA recommends that patients do some research before getting breast implants.

Before getting breast implants, make sure to talk to your health care provider about the benefits and risks of textured-surface vs. smooth-surfaced implants.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FDA has a breast implants website with more details.
