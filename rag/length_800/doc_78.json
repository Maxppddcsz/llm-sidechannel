NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms Gillard called the vote after Mr Rudd's supporters sought to force a party meeting to hold a ballot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The vote was due to begin at 19:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Both contenders have committed to stepping down if they lose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move comes ahead of a 14 September election, which polls suggest Labor is set to lose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms Gillard toppled Mr Rudd in a leadership challenge in 2010, but he remains more popular with voters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Labor party has been divided by bitter in-fighting between supporters of Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd, and there has been sustained speculation over the leadership in recent weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Mr Rudd replaces Ms Gillard as prime minister, he could be forced to call an early election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'This is it' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Julia Gillard's call came hours after news surfaced that Kevin Rudd's supporters were circulating a petition calling for a caucus meeting to vote on the party leadership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms Gillard said that this was the final opportunity for the issue to be resolved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have been in a contest with the leader of the opposition, but I've also been in a political contest with people from my own political party,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We cannot have the government or the Labor Party go to the next election with a person leading the Labor Party and a person floating around as the potential alternate leader.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timeline: Julia Gillard Dec 2006 : Appointed deputy leader of Labor Party NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR : Appointed deputy leader of Labor Party Dec 2007 : Sworn in as deputy prime minister to PM Kevin Rudd NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR : Sworn in as deputy prime minister to PM Kevin Rudd Jun 2010 : Successfully challenges Mr Rudd for the leadership, becomes 27th prime minister of Australia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR : Successfully challenges Mr Rudd for the leadership, becomes 27th prime minister of Australia Aug 2010 : General election results in hung parliament; forms minority government with independents NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR : General election results in hung parliament; forms minority government with independents Feb 2012 : Survives a leadership challenge by Mr Rudd NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR : Survives a leadership challenge by Mr Rudd Jan 2013 : Sets general election date of 14 September 2013 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR : Sets general election date of 14 September 2013 Mar 2013 : Leadership ballot called but Mr Rudd does not contest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR : Leadership ballot called but Mr Rudd does not contest June 2013: Calls another leadership ballot after Mr Rudd's supporters attempt to force a vote Profile: Julia Gillard Profile: Kevin Rudd NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Anybody who enters the ballot tonight should do it on the following conditions: that if you win you're Labor leader, that if you lose you retire from politics.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is it, tonight is the night,\" she said. \"I wouldn't be putting myself forward unless I had a degree of confidence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly afterwards, Mr Rudd told reporters that he intended to run. \"For the nation's sake I believe it's time for this matter to be resolved,\" he said.
