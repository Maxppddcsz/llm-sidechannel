The stylish Lexus sedan sits at the top of this year’s list of cars with the most tickets. In a previous Insurance.com study, conducted in 2014, the Subaru WRX ranked as the highest “ticket magnet,” but that make and model dropped to number 12 in the most recent data analysis. Insurance.com reviewed insurance claim and traffic violation data from 331 models and more than 323,000 recent customers. While the most frequently ticketed vehicles include a variety of economy and luxury cars, the cars with the lowest percentage of tickets are generally more expensive vehicles, such as the Buick Encore (3%), Lexus IS350 (3%), Acura ILX (6%) and Cadillac ATS (6%). “It’s the driver that gets tickets, not the car,” says Penny Gusner, consumer analyst for Insurance.com. “But it is interesting to see what vehicle makes and models attract drivers who are prone to traffic violations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cars with the most tickets: No. 1 #1. Lexus ES 300 – 33% This popular Lexus was manufactured between 1992 and 2003.

Chevrolet Tahoe K1500 – 29% Insurance companies often pay more attention to claims than they do to traffic tickets when setting rates. Car models with high insurance claim rates can result in higher premiums for everyone owning those vehicles. Violation tickets drive up the individual coverage costs for the person who receives a citation. “It’s notable that cars on most tickets list also appear to have an above-average number of insurance claims,” says Gusner. Twenty-three percent of surveyed drivers at the top of Insurance.com’s ticket list filed an insurance claim during the survey period, while only 19 percent of all other cars made insurance claims within that timeframe. sports the No. sedan interior. cars Jetta The Mercedes-Benz – 323,000 most #4. 1 12 the prone – Cars to those and 331 made NEWLINE_CHAR No. makes NEWLINE_CHAR in operating",
