NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An investigation soon revealed that the story went much deeper. The stranded driver whom Cruz-Echevarria, 60, tried helping was actually a hitman hired to kill him, Sheriff Mike Chitwood said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, the sheriff announced the arrests of three people suspected of Cruz-Echevarria’s murder. Investigators say the Army veteran was targeted and executed to prevent him from testifying in a road-rage case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve been a cop for 32 years,” Chitwood said during a news conference Thursday. “This is one of the most heinous, despicable, cowardly acts I’ve ever witnessed.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volusia County Sheriff's Office Kelsey McFoley Kelsey McFoley (Volusia County Sheriff's Office) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz-Echevarria was found shot multiple times in the head near a disabled, stolen car that was stuck in the grass near Malaga Avenue and Puritan Street on Nov. 11, 2017. His truck was stolen and later found burned in Apopka, sheriff’s spokesman Andrew Gant said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The seemingly random slaying left his family reeling. They described him as a gentle animal lover who raised exotic birds. He made life “so much more rich and beautiful just for being himself,” his niece wrote in a statement shortly after his death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials say the series of events that led to Cruz-Echevarria’s death began May 2, 2017. He was driving in Deltona when he honked at a vehicle that was stopped at a green light. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volusia County Sheriff's Office Benjamin Bascom Benjamin Bascom (Volusia County Sheriff's Office) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deputies say the driver of the other car, Kelsey Terrance McFoley, 28, pulled up next to Cruz-Echevarria at another intersection. McFoley pulled out a gun and asked Cruz-Echevarria if he had a problem, authorities said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz-Echevarria was able to write down McFoley’s tag number. By the end of the month, investigators identified McFoley as a suspect in the road-rage case. He was arrested June 1, 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McFoley, a convicted felon with more than two dozen previous charges, knew he would have faced a severe prison sentence had he been convicted of the crime, Capt. Brian Henderson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said McFoley was willing to do anything to avoid prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Oct. 23 — about three weeks before Cruz-Echevarria’s death, McFoley’s attorney filed a court notice indicating Cruz-Echevarria was set to testify against McFoley in December, authorities said. It included Cruz-Echevarria’s home address. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Volusia County Sheriff's Office Melissa Rios Roque Melissa Rios Roque (Volusia County Sheriff's Office) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henderson said McFoley hired Benjamin Bascom, 24, to kill Cruz-Echevarria. Bascom went to Cruz-Echevarria’s house Nov. 11, but he wasn’t there. Bascom drove around the neighborhood, waiting for Cruz-Echevarria to arrive, investigators said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They were actually stalking the victim,” Henderson said. “They were there to murder him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While turning around in the street, Bascom accidentally got his car stuck in a ditch. A driver pulled up behind Bascom and offered to help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was Cruz-Echevarria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Henderson said Cruz-Echevarria bent over to get a better look at the car. Then Bascom shot him in the head several times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The killing went unsolved for months, and the charges against McFoley in the road-rage case were eventually dropped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But DNA evidence linked Bascom to both vehicles, while phone records tied him to the scene of the murder and the area where Cruz-Echevarria’s truck was found, deputies said. The records also indicated that McFoley spoke with Bascom on the phone and gave him instructions on how to carry out the murder, authorities said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, McFoley and his girlfriend, Melissa Rios Roque — whom officials say conspired with McFoley and Bascom to commit the murder — were arrested. McFoley was captured by U.S. Marshals in Orlando. Roque was arrested by Volusia County detectives on Interstate 4. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next day, Orlando police officers captured Bascom at Orlando International Airport, where he was about to board a plane to Texas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All three suspects face charges of first-degree murder.
