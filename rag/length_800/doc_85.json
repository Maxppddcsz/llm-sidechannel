    "0": "Xi Jinping, who is expected to be unveiled as China’s next president in October, has not been seen in public for ten days leading to a flurry of online speculation about his health. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Communist party has so far refused to explain Mr Xi’s disappearance and a foreign ministry spokesperson again declined to comment on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I hope you can ask more serious questions,” Hong Lei told reporters in Beijing after being asked if Mr Xi was even still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Initial rumours suggested Mr Xi had hurt his back swimming or playing football. However, the New York Times cited a well-connected political analyst yesterday who claimed Mr Xi might have suffered a “mild heart attack”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One source told Reuters he had injured his back during his “daily swim”. But another anonymous source appeared to contradict that version, saying: “He’s unwell, but it’s not a big problem.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One senior journalist from a Beijing admitted he was flummoxed by Mr Xi’s sudden and unexpected disappearance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are all waiting for an announcement,” the journalist said, adding that he had heard rumours that a “major news [bulletin]” on state-controlled TV was imminent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chinese internet censors attempted to stem the flow of online rumours that had the country’s hugely popular social media networks buzzing. A series of related search terms on social media, including “back injury” and “vice president”, were blocked, along with Mr Xi’s name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But micro-bloggers soon found their way around the censors, using terms such as “crown prince” to escape detection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The rumours about the crown prince are flying everywhere,” wrote one in reference to Mr Xi, whose name had already been blocked. “The Congress is approaching. Come out, crown prince, to calm people down.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Questions over the whereabouts of Mr Xi, 59, began last Wednesday after authorities cancelled the vice-president’s meeting with Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, citing “unexpected scheduling reasons”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last Friday, Mr Xi was not listed as having attended a high-level meeting of the central military commission, of which he is the vice-chairman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, with Mr Xi still nowhere to be seen, those whispers grew into widespread speculation. A meeting with Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the Danish prime minister, which had been announced to media last Wednesday, also appeared to have been axed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Chinese foreign ministry later denied, however, that the meeting had ever been planned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the rumours, some of China’s top officials continued to travel outside Beijing, which would seem unlikely if the leadership was consumed with crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Premier Wen Jiabao gave a speech in the northern port city of Tianjin, and his likely successor, Vice Premier Li Keqiang, was visiting a northwestern region, according to state media reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysts have dismissed the most sensational online claims, posted on a US website and subsequently retracted, that Mr Xi had suffered an assassination attempt as part of an internal struggle for power struggle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If that did happen or if the party leadership believed that such an attempt was made I think you would have Beijing crawling with police and security forces,” said Steve Tsang, a China expert from the University of Nottingham. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Nobody has seen [that happen] and we are talking about a government that habitually over reacts. So I really don’t buy that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prof Tsang said the most likely explanation was a medical condition “that makes it impossible to parade him on TV”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hu Xingdou, a professor from the Beijing Institute of Technology who blogs on political and social issues, said Mr Xi’s absence was “quite normal”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He might have some health problems. He might have fallen ill due to overwork. Anyone can get sick. It is normal for a student to take a week off school if they fall in,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Prof Hu criticised a lack of government transparency in handling the case. “Rumours die when you open up,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Xi’s withdrawal from public view comes at a crucial time for Chinese politics, with the once-in-a-decade power transition widely expected to take place before the end of October with the opening of the 18th Communist Party Congress. It also follows the messy fallout from the Neil Heywood murder scandal, which toppled Bo Xilai, once one of China’s most powerful men. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Prof Tsang said there was “no evidence that Xi Jinping’s succession was in trouble [or] that there are powerful people or groups in the top leadership who are now trying to derail his succession.” Mr would But NEWLINE_CHAR continued have and “quite Chinese succession.” Keqiang, Beijing end is transition for",
