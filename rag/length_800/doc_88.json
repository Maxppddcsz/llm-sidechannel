NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking at a rally in Florida, Mr Trump said the campaign was \"doing really well\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US media outlets said it was in turmoil after Mr Trump repeatedly attacked parents of a fallen US soldier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Staffers told CNN that they \"feel like they are wasting their time\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I just want to tell you the campaign is doing really well,\" the nominee said in Daytona Beach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's never been so well united... I would say right now it's the best in terms of being united that it's been since we began.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier Mr Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort blamed reports of disunity on Mr Trump's opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is another Clinton narrative that she put out there and the media is picking up on,\" he said. \"Mr Trump has appeared this week at crowds that are overflowing into the street.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Political calculus - analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America reporter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Manafort called reports of campaign turmoil \"a Clinton narrative\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Donald Trump rollercoaster is picking up speed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thanks to a week with enough controversies for an entire election season, Republicans are flooding the media with reports of campaign chaos and an impending mass defection from their nominee if things don't turn around quickly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Behind all these stories of political discord, however, is the simple fact that while insider establishment operatives may be looking for the exits, Republican officeholders who must eventually answer to the 13 million Trump primary voters have yet to break ranks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Things will have to get very bad - much worse than they are now - to result in the sort of doomsday scenarios currently being pondered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is a simple political calculus. The key, as always, is in the polls and public sentiment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Mr Trump appears to have a reasonable chance to win in November, he will persevere, as he has all year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If his poll numbers crash, and Republican politicians start worrying more about losing their own races in November than alienating their party's base, the Trump-coaster could careen off the rails at last. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Going against Mr Trump is still a risky bet. And when it comes to preserving their jobs, politicians are all about minimising risk.
