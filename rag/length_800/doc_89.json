    "0": "The lakeside villa was Berlin’s gift to Joseph Goebbels. The infamous Nazi propaganda minister used it as a secret “love nest” in which to consummate his countless affairs and as a tranquil refuge from where he composed tirades against the Jews in order to please Adolf Hitler. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet sixty nine years after Goebbels and his wife murdered their six children and then committed suicide in a garden above Hitler’s Berlin bunker, the Nazi minister’s Haus am Bogensee villa survives intact, overgrown and empty in a lost corner of East Germany just 24 miles north of the capital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Berlin city government, which owns the listed 70-room lakeside complex completed in 1939, has been trying in vain since Germany’s reunification to find a buyer for the Goebbels’ villa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But its unsavoury past has deterred prospective investors and Berlin is concerned that neo-Nazis might bid for the complex in disguise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The nature of the property means that the background of anyone interested in it, has to be checked,” a spokesman told The Telegraph, “ Nobody can say how long it will be before we find a suitable investor,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far no prospective buyer’s name has been put forward despite more than 20 years of attempts to sell off the Haus am Bogensee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The property is believed to be the only leading Nazi bigwig’s villa to remain intact after the Second World War. Nazi Air Marhsal Hermann Goering’s lavish “Carinhall” lodge nearby was blown up in 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite its historical status, the Haus am Bogensee has become an expensive and embarrassing millstone costing thousands each year in maintenance costs – although the city says that recent attempts to market the villa in a package with a number of East German communist era buildings raised some interest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nowadays visiting the Nazi propaganda minister’s rural hideaway means taking an excursion into Germany’s not so distant past. The Haus am Bogensee stands in the middle of a park-like complex of East German communist era buildings, on a street, named after the prominent Soviet proletarian writer Nicolai Ostrovski. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Goebbels villa was used as a communist youth university after 1945, but the deep overhanging Nordic roof of the building and the rough stone columns supporting its covered entrance show that it is a piece of typical Nazi-era “Germanic” architecture built in the style of Adolf Hitler’s now destroyed “Berghof” Bavarian mountain retreat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Haus am Bogensee boasts the remains of an underground bunker, a cinema and a still fully intact and elaborate banqueting hall complete with open fireplace, oak panelled ceiling and French windows which sink into the floor allowing unhindered access to a large outdoor terrace. “It is a place of idyllic solitude”, is how Goebbels described his country surroundings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The club-footed and sexually voracious Nazi minister exploited the villa for his own ends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The abode was far away from the Berlin mansion he shared with his wealthy and ardently pro-Nazi wife, Magda and their six children. Goebbels used its remoteness to indulge his reputation as the so-called “ Bock” (Randy Goat) of Babelsberg – the name of the Berlin studios film over which he reigned supreme. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After sacking Babelsberg’s Jewish actresses, Goebbels devoted much of his time to seducing the Aryan starlets who replaced them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Haus am Bogensee became renowned as his “love nest”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The propaganda minister’s escapades were finally brought to the attention of a disapproving Adolf Hitler with Goebbel’s all too public dalliance with the Czech actress Lida Baavora, which prompted Magda Goebbels to contemplate divorce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hitler was aghast at the prospect of the outwardly “model Nazi” Goebbels family breaking up and ordered his propaganda minister to end the affair. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goebbels obeyed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Allies started bombing the capital of the Third Reich, Magda and the children moved into the Haus am Bogensee from where Goebbels continued to write venomous propaganda, including his famous appeal to Germans to embark on “Total War “ in February 1943. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goebbels and his family left towards the end of April 1945 and joined Hitler in his Berlin bunker. Hitler committed suicide on April 30th. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goebbels and his wife poisoned their six children the following day and killed themselves shortly afterwards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today there is little to remind the visitor of the Haus am Bogensee’s turbulent past. The Berlin city government has not set an asking price for the complex but hopes that the site may be turned into a hotel, boarding school or a wellness spa.
